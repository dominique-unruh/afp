This is a formalization of the article &#34;Knight&#39;s Tour Revisited&#34; by
Cull and De Curtins where they prove the existence of a Knight&#39;s
path for arbitrary &lt;i&gt;n &amp;times; m&lt;/i&gt;-boards with &lt;i&gt;min(n,m) &amp;le;
5&lt;/i&gt;. If &lt;i&gt;n &amp;middot; m&lt;/i&gt; is even, then there exists a Knight&#39;s
circuit.  A Knight&#39;s Path is a sequence of moves of a Knight on a
chessboard s.t. the Knight visits every square of a chessboard
exactly once.  Finding a Knight&#39;s path is a an instance of the
Hamiltonian path problem. A Knight&#39;s circuit is a Knight&#39;s path,
where additionally the Knight can move from the last square to the
first square of the path, forming a loop.  During the formalization
two mistakes in the original proof were discovered. These mistakes
are corrected in this formalization.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Hyperdual numbers are ones with a real component and a number
of infinitesimal components, usually written as $a_0 + a_1 \cdot
\epsilon_1 + a_2 \cdot \epsilon_2 + a_3 \cdot \epsilon_1\epsilon_2$.
They have been proposed by &lt;a
href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2011-886&#34;&gt;Fike and
Alonso&lt;/a&gt; in an approach to automatic
differentiation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this entry we formalise
hyperdual numbers and their application to forward differentiation. We
show them to be an instance of multiple algebraic structures and then,
along with facts about twice-differentiability, we define what we call
the hyperdual extensions of functions on real-normed fields. This
extension formally represents the proposed way that the first and
second derivatives of a function can be automatically calculated. We
demonstrate it on the standard logistic function $f(x) = \frac{1}{1 +
e^{-x}}$ and also reproduce the example analytic function $f(x) =
\frac{e^x}{\sqrt{sin(x)^3 + cos(x)^3}}$ used for demonstration by Fike
and Alonso.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is a stepwise refinement and proof of the Gale-Shapley stable
matching (or marriage) algorithm down to executable code. Both a
purely functional implementation based on lists and a functional
implementation based on efficient arrays (provided by the Collections
Framework in the AFP) are developed. The latter implementation runs in
time &lt;i&gt;O(n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/i&gt; where
&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; is the cardinality of the two sets to be matched.</description>

We formalise a proof of Roth&#39;s Theorem on Arithmetic
Progressions, a major result in additive combinatorics on the
existence of 3-term arithmetic progressions in subsets of natural
numbers. To this end, we follow a proof using graph regularity. We
employ our recent formalisation of Szemerédi&#39;s Regularity Lemma,
a major result in extremal graph theory, which we use here to prove
the Triangle Counting Lemma and the Triangle Removal Lemma. Our
sources are Yufei Zhao&#39;s MIT lecture notes

We present a formalization of Markov Decision Processes with rewards.
In particular we first build on Hölzl&#39;s formalization  of MDPs
(AFP entry: Markov_Models) and extend them with rewards. We proceed
with an analysis of the expected total discounted reward criterion for
infinite horizon MDPs. The central result is the construction of the
iteration rule for the Bellman operator. We prove the optimality
equations for this operator and show the existence of an optimal
stationary deterministic solution. The analysis can be used to obtain
dynamic programming algorithms such as value iteration and policy
iteration to solve MDPs with formal guarantees. Our formalization is
based on chapters 5 and 6 in Puterman&#39;s book &#34;Markov
Decision Processes: Discrete Stochastic Dynamic Programming&#34;.</description>

We present a formalization of algorithms for solving Markov Decision
Processes (MDPs) with formal guarantees on the optimality of their
solutions. In particular we build on our analysis of the Bellman
operator for discounted infinite horizon MDPs. From the iterator rule
on the Bellman operator we directly derive executable value iteration
and policy iteration algorithms to iteratively solve finite MDPs. We
also prove correct optimized versions of value iteration that use
matrix splittings to improve the convergence rate. In particular, we
formally verify Gauss-Seidel value iteration and modified policy
iteration. The algorithms are evaluated on two standard examples from
the literature, namely, inventory management and gridworld. Our
formalization covers most of chapter 6 in Puterman&#39;s book
&#34;Markov Decision Processes: Discrete Stochastic Dynamic
Programming&#34;.</description>

Tree automata have good closure properties and therefore a commonly
used to prove/disprove properties. This formalization contains among
other things the proofs of many closure properties of tree automata
(anchored) ground tree transducers and regular relations. Additionally
it includes the well known pumping lemma and a lifting of the Myhill
Nerode theorem for regular languages to tree languages.  We want to
mention the existence of a &lt;a
href=&#34;https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Tree-Automata.html&#34;&gt;tree
automata APF-entry&lt;/a&gt; developed by Peter Lammich. His work is
based on epsilon free top-down tree automata, while this entry builds
on bottom-up tree auotamta with epsilon transitions. Moreover our
formalization relies on the &lt;a
href=&#34;https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Collections.html&#34;&gt;Collections
Framework&lt;/a&gt;, also by Peter Lammich, to obtain efficient code.
All proven constructions of the closure properties are exportable
using the Isabelle/HOL code generation facilities.</description>

In this work we formalise the isomorphism between simplicial complexes
of dimension $n$ and monotone Boolean functions in $n$ variables,
mainly following the definitions and results as introduced by N. A.
Scoville. We also take advantage of the AFP
representation of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/ROBDD.html&#34;&gt;ROBDD&lt;/a&gt;
(Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams) to compute the ROBDD representation of a
given simplicial complex (by means of the isomorphism to Boolean
functions). Some examples of simplicial complexes and associated
Boolean functions are also presented.</description>

The &lt;em&gt;van Emde Boas tree&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;van Emde Boas
priority queue&lt;/em&gt; is a data structure supporting membership
test, insertion, predecessor and successor search, minimum and maximum
determination and deletion in &lt;em&gt;O(log log U)&lt;/em&gt; time, where &lt;em&gt;U =
0,...,2&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is the overall range to be
considered. &lt;p/&gt; The presented formalization follows Chapter 20
of the popular &lt;em&gt;Introduction to Algorithms (3rd
ed.)&lt;/em&gt; by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein (CLRS),
extending the list of formally verified CLRS algorithms. Our current
formalization is based on the first author&#39;s bachelor&#39;s
thesis. &lt;p/&gt; First, we prove correct a
&lt;em&gt;functional&lt;/em&gt; implementation, w.r.t. an abstract
data type for sets. Apart from functional correctness, we show a
resource bound, and runtime bounds w.r.t. manually defined timing
functions for the operations. &lt;p/&gt; Next, we refine the
operations to Imperative HOL with time, and show correctness and
complexity. This yields a practically more efficient implementation,
and eliminates the manually defined timing functions from the trusted
base of the proof.</description>

In this work we formalize the Hahn decomposition theorem for signed
measures, namely that any measure space for a signed measure can be
decomposed into a positive and a negative set, where every measurable
subset of the positive one has a positive measure, and every
measurable subset of the negative one has a negative measure. We also
formalize the Jordan decomposition theorem as a corollary, which
states that the signed measure under consideration admits a unique
decomposition into a difference of two positive measures, at least one
of which is finite.</description>

       <description>
&lt;p&gt;Simplified variants of Gödel&#39;s ontological argument are
explored. Among those is a particularly interesting simplified
argument which is (i) valid already in basic
modal logics K or KT, (ii) which does not suffer from modal collapse,
and (iii) which avoids the rather complex predicates of essence (Ess.)
and necessary existence (NE) as used by Gödel.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Whether the presented variants increase or decrease the
attractiveness and persuasiveness of the ontological argument is a
question I would like to pass on to philosophy and theology.

       <description>
In this formalisation, we  construct real exponents as the limits of
sequences of rational exponents. In particular, if $a \ge 1$ and $x
\in \mathbb{R}$, we choose an increasing rational sequence $r_n$ such
that $\lim_{n\to\infty} {r_n} = x$. Then the sequence $a^{r_n}$ is
increasing and if $r$ is any rational number such that $r &gt; x$,
$a^{r_n}$ is bounded above by $a^r$. By the convergence criterion for
monotone sequences, $a^{r_n}$ converges. We define $a^ x =
\lim_{n\to\infty} a^{r_n}$ and show that it has the expected
properties (for $a \ge 0$).  This particular construction of real
exponents is needed instead of the usual one using the natural
logarithm and exponential functions (which already exists in Isabelle)
to support our mechanical derivation of Euler&#39;s exponential
series as an ``infinite polynomial&#34;. Aside from helping us avoid
circular reasoning, this is, as far as we are aware, the first time
real exponents are mechanised in this way within a proof assistant.</description>

The AFP already contains a verified implementation of algebraic
numbers. However, it is has a severe limitation in its factorization
algorithm of real and complex polynomials: the factorization is only
guaranteed to succeed if the coefficients of the polynomial are
rational numbers. In this work, we verify an algorithm to factor all
real and complex polynomials whose coefficients are algebraic. The
existence of such an algorithm proves in a constructive way that the
set of complex algebraic numbers is algebraically closed. Internally,
the algorithm is based on resultants of multivariate polynomials and
an approximation algorithm using interval arithmetic.</description>

regularity lemma&lt;/a&gt; is a key result in the study of large
graphs. It asserts the existence of an upper bound on the number of parts
the vertices of a graph need to be partitioned into such that the
edges between the parts are random in a certain sense. This bound
depends only on the desired precision and not on the graph itself, in
the spirit of Ramsey&#39;s theorem. The formalisation follows online

A formalization of the theory of quantum and classical registers as
developed by (Unruh, Quantum and Classical Registers). In a nutshell,
a register refers to a part of a larger memory or system that can be
accessed independently.  Registers can be constructed from other
registers and several (compatible) registers can be composed. This
formalization develops both the generic theory of registers as well as
specific instantiations for classical and quantum registers.</description>

The 1985 paper by Carlos Alchourrón, Peter Gärdenfors, and David
Makinson (AGM), “On the Logic of Theory Change: Partial Meet
Contraction and Revision Functions” launches a large and rapidly
growing literature that employs formal models and logics to handle
changing beliefs of a rational agent and to take into account new
piece of information observed by this agent. In 2011, a review book
titled &#34;AGM 25 Years: Twenty-Five Years of Research in Belief
Change&#34; was edited to summarize the first twenty five years of
works based on AGM.  This  HOL-based  AFP entry is a faithful
formalization of the AGM operators (e.g. contraction, revision,
remainder ...) axiomatized in the original paper. It also contains the
proofs of all the theorems stated in the paper that show how these
operators combine. Both proofs of Harper and Levi identities are
established.</description>

       <description>
This AFP entry provides semantics for roughly 120 different X86-64
assembly instructions. These instructions include various moves,
arithmetic/logical operations, jumps, call/return, SIMD extensions and
others. External functions are supported by allowing a user to provide
custom semantics for these calls. Floating-point operations are mapped
to uninterpreted functions. The model provides semantics for register
aliasing and a byte-level little-endian memory model. The semantics
are purposefully incomplete, but overapproximative. For example, the
precise effect of flags may be undefined for certain instructions, or
instructions may simply have no semantics at all. In those cases, the
semantics are mapped to universally quantified uninterpreted terms
from a locale. Second, this entry provides a method to symbolic
execution of basic blocks. The method, called
&#39;&#39;se_step&#39;&#39; (for: symbolic execution step) fetches
an instruction and updates the current symbolic state while keeping
track of assumptions made over the memory model. A key component is a
set of theorems that prove how reads from memory resolve after writes
have occurred. Thirdly, this entry provides a parser that allows the
user to copy-paste the output of the standard disassembly tool objdump
into Isabelle/HOL. A couple small and explanatory examples are
included, including functions from the word count program. Several
examples can be supplied upon request (they are not included due to
the running time of verification): functions from the floating-point
modulo function from FDLIBM, the GLIBC strlen function and the
CoreUtils SHA256 implementation.</description>

We study models of state-based non-deterministic sequential
computations and describe them using algebras. We propose algebras
that describe iteration for strict and non-strict computations. They
unify computation models which differ in the fixpoints used to
represent iteration. We propose algebras that describe the infinite
executions of a computation. They lead to a unified approximation
order and results that connect fixpoints in the approximation and
refinement orders. This unifies the semantics of recursion for a range
of computation models. We propose algebras that describe preconditions
and the effect of while-programs under postconditions. They unify
correctness statements in two dimensions: one statement applies in
various computation models to various correctness claims.</description>

This paper presents a formally verified quantifier elimination (QE)
algorithm for first-order real arithmetic by linear and quadratic
virtual substitution (VS) in Isabelle/HOL. The Tarski-Seidenberg
theorem established that the first-order logic of real arithmetic is
decidable by QE. However, in practice, QE algorithms are highly
complicated and often combine multiple methods for performance. VS is
a practically successful method for QE that targets formulas with
low-degree polynomials. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
formalize VS for quadratic real arithmetic including inequalities. The
proofs necessitate various contributions to the existing multivariate
polynomial libraries in Isabelle/HOL. Our framework is modularized and
easily expandable (to facilitate integrating future optimizations),
and could serve as a basis for developing practical general-purpose QE
algorithms. Further, as our formalization is designed with
practicality in mind, we export our development to SML and test the
resulting code on 378 benchmarks from the literature, comparing to
Redlog, Z3, Wolfram Engine, and SMT-RAT. This identified
inconsistencies in some tools, underscoring the significance of a
verified approach for the intricacies of real arithmetic.</description>

This work is a formalization of the soundness and completeness of an
axiomatic system for first-order logic. The proof system is based on
System Q1 by Smullyan and the completeness proof follows his textbook
&#34;First-Order Logic&#34; (Springer-Verlag 1968). The completeness
proof is in the Henkin style where a consistent set is extended to a
maximal consistent set using Lindenbaum&#39;s construction and Henkin
witnesses are added during the construction to ensure saturation as
well. The resulting set is a Hintikka set which, by the model
existence theorem, is satisfiable in the Herbrand universe.</description>

We present a formalization of bounded operators on complex vector
spaces.  Our formalization contains material on complex vector spaces
(normed spaces, Banach spaces, Hilbert spaces) that complements and
goes beyond the developments of real vectors spaces in the
Isabelle/HOL standard library.  We define the type of bounded
operators between complex vector spaces
(&lt;em&gt;cblinfun&lt;/em&gt;) and develop the theory of unitaries,
projectors, extension of bounded linear functions (BLT theorem),
adjoints, Loewner order, closed subspaces and more.  For the
finite-dimensional case, we provide code generation support by
identifying finite-dimensional operators with matrices as formalized
in the &lt;a href=&#34;Jordan_Normal_Form.html&#34;&gt;Jordan_Normal_Form&lt;/a&gt; AFP entry.</description>

We define the weighted path order (WPO) and formalize several
properties such as strong normalization, the subterm property, and
closure properties under substitutions and contexts. Our definition of
WPO extends the original definition by also permitting multiset
comparisons of arguments instead of just lexicographic extensions.
Therefore, our WPO not only subsumes lexicographic path orders (LPO),
but also recursive path orders (RPO). We formally prove these
subsumptions and therefore all of the mentioned properties of WPO are
automatically transferable to LPO and RPO as well. Such a
transformation is not required for Knuth&amp;ndash;Bendix orders
(KBO), since they have already been formalized. Nevertheless, we still
provide a proof that WPO subsumes KBO and thereby underline the
generality of WPO.</description>

In their article titled &lt;i&gt;From Types to Sets by Local Type
Definitions in Higher-Order Logic&lt;/i&gt; and published in the
proceedings of the conference &lt;i&gt;Interactive Theorem
Proving&lt;/i&gt; in 2016, Ondřej Kunčar and Andrei Popescu propose an
extension of the logic Isabelle/HOL and an associated algorithm for
the relativization of the &lt;i&gt;type-based theorems&lt;/i&gt; to
more flexible &lt;i&gt;set-based theorems&lt;/i&gt;, collectively
referred to as &lt;i&gt;Types-To-Sets&lt;/i&gt;. One of the aims of
their work was to open an opportunity for the development of a
software tool for applied relativization in the implementation of the
logic Isabelle/HOL of the proof assistant Isabelle. In this article,
we provide a prototype of a software framework for the interactive
automated relativization of theorems in Isabelle/HOL, developed as an
extension of the proof language Isabelle/Isar. The software framework
incorporates the implementation of the proposed extension of the
logic, and builds upon some of the ideas for further work expressed in
the original article on Types-To-Sets by Ondřej Kunčar and Andrei
Popescu and the subsequent article &lt;i&gt;Smooth Manifolds and Types
to Sets for Linear Algebra in Isabelle/HOL&lt;/i&gt; that was written
by Fabian Immler and Bohua Zhan and published in the proceedings of
the &lt;i&gt;International Conference on Certified Programs and
Proofs&lt;/i&gt; in 2019.</description>

The article provides a collection of experimental general-purpose
proof methods for the object logic Isabelle/HOL of the formal proof
assistant Isabelle. The methods in the collection offer functionality
that is similar to certain aspects of the functionality provided by
the standard proof methods of Isabelle that combine classical
reasoning and rewriting, such as the method &lt;i&gt;auto&lt;/i&gt;,
but use a different approach for rewriting. More specifically, these
methods allow for the side conditions of the rewrite rules to be
solved via intro-resolution.</description>

This article provides a foundational framework for the formalization
of category theory in the object logic ZFC in HOL of the formal proof
assistant Isabelle. More specifically, this article provides a
formalization of canonical set-theoretic constructions internalized in
the type &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt; associated with the ZFC in HOL,
establishes a design pattern for the formalization of mathematical
structures using sequences and locales, and showcases the developed
infrastructure by providing formalizations of the elementary theories
of digraphs and semicategories. The methodology chosen for the
formalization of the theories of digraphs and semicategories (and
categories in future articles) rests on the ideas that were originally
expressed in the article &lt;i&gt;Set-Theoretical Foundations of
Category Theory&lt;/i&gt; written by Solomon Feferman and Georg
Kreisel. Thus, in the context of this work, each of the aforementioned
mathematical structures is represented as a term of the type
&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt; embedded into a stage of the von Neumann
hierarchy.</description>
