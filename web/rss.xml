       <description>
This work is a formalization of the soundness and completeness of an
axiomatic system for first-order logic. The proof system is based on
System Q1 by Smullyan and the completeness proof follows his textbook
&#34;First-Order Logic&#34; (Springer-Verlag 1968). The completeness
proof is in the Henkin style where a consistent set is extended to a
maximal consistent set using Lindenbaum&#39;s construction and Henkin
witnesses are added during the construction to ensure saturation as
well. The resulting set is a Hintikka set which, by the model
existence theorem, is satisfiable in the Herbrand universe.</description>

We present a formalization of bounded operators on complex vector
spaces.  Our formalization contains material on complex vector spaces
(normed spaces, Banach spaces, Hilbert spaces) that complements and
goes beyond the developments of real vectors spaces in the
Isabelle/HOL standard library.  We define the type of bounded
operators between complex vector spaces
(&lt;em&gt;cblinfun&lt;/em&gt;) and develop the theory of unitaries,
projectors, extension of bounded linear functions (BLT theorem),
adjoints, Loewner order, closed subspaces and more.  For the
finite-dimensional case, we provide code generation support by
identifying finite-dimensional operators with matrices as formalized
in the &lt;a href=&#34;Jordan_Normal_Form.html&#34;&gt;Jordan_Normal_Form&lt;/a&gt; AFP entry.</description>

       <description>
We define the weighted path order (WPO) and formalize several
properties such as strong normalization, the subterm property, and
closure properties under substitutions and contexts. Our definition of
WPO extends the original definition by also permitting multiset
comparisons of arguments instead of just lexicographic extensions.
Therefore, our WPO not only subsumes lexicographic path orders (LPO),
but also recursive path orders (RPO). We formally prove these
subsumptions and therefore all of the mentioned properties of WPO are
automatically transferable to LPO and RPO as well. Such a
transformation is not required for Knuth&amp;ndash;Bendix orders
(KBO), since they have already been formalized. Nevertheless, we still
provide a proof that WPO subsumes KBO and thereby underline the
generality of WPO.</description>

In their article titled &lt;i&gt;From Types to Sets by Local Type
Definitions in Higher-Order Logic&lt;/i&gt; and published in the
proceedings of the conference &lt;i&gt;Interactive Theorem
Proving&lt;/i&gt; in 2016, Ondřej Kunčar and Andrei Popescu propose an
extension of the logic Isabelle/HOL and an associated algorithm for
the relativization of the &lt;i&gt;type-based theorems&lt;/i&gt; to
more flexible &lt;i&gt;set-based theorems&lt;/i&gt;, collectively
referred to as &lt;i&gt;Types-To-Sets&lt;/i&gt;. One of the aims of
their work was to open an opportunity for the development of a
software tool for applied relativization in the implementation of the
logic Isabelle/HOL of the proof assistant Isabelle. In this article,
we provide a prototype of a software framework for the interactive
automated relativization of theorems in Isabelle/HOL, developed as an
extension of the proof language Isabelle/Isar. The software framework
incorporates the implementation of the proposed extension of the
logic, and builds upon some of the ideas for further work expressed in
the original article on Types-To-Sets by Ondřej Kunčar and Andrei
Popescu and the subsequent article &lt;i&gt;Smooth Manifolds and Types
to Sets for Linear Algebra in Isabelle/HOL&lt;/i&gt; that was written
by Fabian Immler and Bohua Zhan and published in the proceedings of
the &lt;i&gt;International Conference on Certified Programs and
Proofs&lt;/i&gt; in 2019.</description>

The article provides a collection of experimental general-purpose
proof methods for the object logic Isabelle/HOL of the formal proof
assistant Isabelle. The methods in the collection offer functionality
that is similar to certain aspects of the functionality provided by
the standard proof methods of Isabelle that combine classical
reasoning and rewriting, such as the method &lt;i&gt;auto&lt;/i&gt;,
but use a different approach for rewriting. More specifically, these
methods allow for the side conditions of the rewrite rules to be
solved via intro-resolution.</description>

This article provides a foundational framework for the formalization
of category theory in the object logic ZFC in HOL of the formal proof
assistant Isabelle. More specifically, this article provides a
formalization of canonical set-theoretic constructions internalized in
the type &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt; associated with the ZFC in HOL,
establishes a design pattern for the formalization of mathematical
structures using sequences and locales, and showcases the developed
infrastructure by providing formalizations of the elementary theories
of digraphs and semicategories. The methodology chosen for the
formalization of the theories of digraphs and semicategories (and
categories in future articles) rests on the ideas that were originally
expressed in the article &lt;i&gt;Set-Theoretical Foundations of
Category Theory&lt;/i&gt; written by Solomon Feferman and Georg
Kreisel. Thus, in the context of this work, each of the aforementioned
mathematical structures is represented as a term of the type
&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt; embedded into a stage of the von Neumann
hierarchy.</description>

This entry formalises the fast iterative algorithm for computing dominators
due to Cooper, Harvey and Kennedy. It gives a specification of computing
dominators on a control
flow graph where each node refers to its reverse post order number. A
semilattice of reversed-ordered list which represents dominators is
built and a Kildall-style algorithm on the semilattice is defined for
computing dominators. Finally the soundness and completeness of the
algorithm are proved w.r.t. the specification.</description>

&lt;p&gt;We formalize Cardano&#39;s formula to solve a cubic equation
$$ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0,$$ as well as Ferrari&#39;s formula to
solve a quartic equation. We further turn both formulas into
executable algorithms based on the algebraic number implementation in
the AFP. To this end we also slightly extended this library, namely by
making the minimal polynomial of an algebraic number executable, and
by defining and implementing $n$-th roots of complex
numbers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In the context of formal cryptographic protocol verification,
logging-independent message anonymity is the property for a given
message to remain anonymous despite the attacker&#39;s capability of
mapping messages of that sort to agents based on some intrinsic
feature of such messages, rather than by logging the messages
exchanged by legitimate agents as with logging-dependent message
anonymity.
This paper illustrates how logging-independent message
anonymity can be formalized according to the relational method for
formal protocol verification by considering a real-world protocol,
namely the Restricted Identification one by the BSI. This sample model
is used to verify that the pseudonymous identifiers output by user
identification tokens remain anonymous under the expected conditions.</description>

The Descartes test based on Bernstein coefficients and Descartes’ rule
of signs effectively (over-)approximates the number of real roots of a
univariate polynomial over an interval. In this entry we formalise the
theorem of three circles, which gives sufficient conditions for when
the Descartes test returns 0 or 1. This is the first step for
efficient root isolation.</description>

This entry contains the confidentiality verification of the

confidentiality properties are formalized as instances of BD Security

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Bounded_Deducibility_Security.html&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;].
An innovation in the deployment of BD Security compared to previous
work is the use of dynamic declassification triggers, incorporated as
part of inductive bounds, for providing stronger guarantees that
account for the repeated opening and closing of access windows. To
further strengthen the confidentiality guarantees, we also prove
&#34;traceback&#34; properties about the accessibility decisions
affecting the information managed by the system.</description>

Building on a previous &lt;a

entry&lt;/a&gt; that formalizes the Bounded-Deducibility Security (BD
Security) framework &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ITP.2021.3&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;,
we formalize compositionality and transport theorems for information
flow security. These results allow lifting BD Security properties from
individual components specified as transition systems, to a
composition of systems specified as communicating products of
transition systems. The underlying ideas of these results are
presented in the papers &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ITP.2021.3&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1109/SP.2017.24&#34;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;.
The latter paper also describes a major case study where these results
have been used: on verifying the CoSMeDis distributed social media
platform (itself formalized as an &lt;a

       <description>
Combinatorial design theory studies incidence set systems with certain
balance and symmetry properties. It is closely related to hypergraph
theory. This formalisation presents a general library for formal
reasoning on incidence set systems, designs and their applications,
including formal definitions and proofs for many key properties,
operations, and theorems on the construction and existence of designs.
Notably, this includes formalising t-designs, balanced incomplete
block designs (BIBD), group divisible designs (GDD), pairwise balanced
designs (PBD), design isomorphisms, and the relationship between
graphs and designs. A locale-centric approach has been used to manage
the relationships between the many different types of designs.
Theorems of particular interest include the necessary conditions for
existence of a BIBD, Wilson&#39;s construction on GDDs, and
Bose&#39;s inequality on resolvable designs. Parts of this
formalisation are explored in the paper &#34;A Modular First
Formalisation of Combinatorial Design Theory&#34;, presented at CICM 2021.</description>

We study second-order formalisations of graph properties expressed as
first-order formulas in relation algebras extended with a Kleene star.
The formulas quantify over relations while still avoiding
quantification over elements of the base set. We formalise the
property of undirected graphs being acyclic this way. This involves a
study of various kinds of orientation of graphs. We also verify basic
algorithms to constructively prove several second-order properties.</description>

This is a formalisation of Schutz&#39; system of axioms for Minkowski
spacetime published under the name &#34;Independent axioms for
Minkowski space-time&#34; in 1997, as well as most of the results in
the third chapter (&#34;Temporal Order on a Path&#34;) of the above
monograph. Many results are proven here that cannot be found in
Schutz, either preceding the theorem they are needed for, or within
their own thematic section.</description>

       <description>
This article deals with the formalisation of some group-theoretic
results including the fundamental theorem of finitely generated
abelian groups characterising the structure of these groups as a
uniquely determined product of cyclic groups. Both the invariant
factor decomposition and the primary decomposition are covered.
Additional work includes results about the direct product, the
internal direct product and more group-theoretic lemmas.</description>

SpecCheck is a &lt;a
href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck&#34;&gt;QuickCheck&lt;/a&gt;-like
testing framework for Isabelle/ML. You can use it to write
specifications for ML functions. SpecCheck then checks whether your
specification holds by testing your function against a given number of
generated inputs. It helps you to identify bugs by printing
counterexamples on failure and provides you timing information.
SpecCheck is customisable and allows you to specify your own input
generators, test output formats, as well as pretty printers and
shrinking functions for counterexamples among other things.</description>

       <description>
This article formalises the proof of Van der Waerden&#39;s Theorem
from Ramsey theory.  Van der Waerden&#39;s Theorem states that for
integers $k$ and $l$ there exists a number $N$ which guarantees that
if an integer interval of length at least $N$ is coloured with $k$
colours, there will always be an arithmetic progression of length $l$
of the same colour in said interval. The proof goes along the lines of
\cite{Swan}.  The smallest number $N_{k,l}$ fulfilling Van der
Waerden&#39;s Theorem is then called the Van der Waerden Number.
Finding the Van der Waerden Number is still an open problem for most
values of $k$ and $l$.</description>

       <title>MiniSail - A kernel language for the ISA specification language SAIL</title>

       <description>
MiniSail is a kernel language for Sail, an instruction set
architecture (ISA) specification language. Sail is an imperative
language with a light-weight dependent type system similar to
refinement type systems. From an ISA specification, the Sail compiler
can generate theorem prover code and C (or OCaml) to give an
executable emulator for an architecture. The idea behind MiniSail is
to capture the key and novel features of Sail in terms of their
syntax, typing rules and operational semantics, and to confirm that
they work together by proving progress and preservation lemmas. We use
the Nominal2 library to handle binding.</description>

This work is a formalization of public announcement logic with
countably many agents. It includes proofs of soundness and
completeness for a variant of the axiom system PA + DIST! + NEC!. The
completeness proof builds on the Epistemic Logic theory.</description>

       <title>A Shorter Compiler Correctness Proof for Language IMP</title>

       <description>
This paper presents a compiler correctness proof for the didactic
imperative programming language IMP, introduced in Nipkow and
Klein&#39;s book on formal programming language semantics (version of
March 2021), whose size is just two thirds of the book&#39;s proof in
the number of formal text lines. As such, it promises to constitute a
further enhanced reference for the formal verification of compilers
meant for larger, real-world programming languages.  The presented
proof does not depend on language determinism, so that the proposed
approach can be applied to non-deterministic languages as well. As a
confirmation, this paper extends IMP with an additional
non-deterministic choice command, and proves compiler correctness,
viz. the simulation of compiled code execution by source code, for
such extended language.</description>

Lyndon words are words lexicographically minimal in their conjugacy
class. We formalize their basic properties and characterizations, in
particular the concepts of the longest Lyndon suffix and the Lyndon
factorization. Most of the work assumes a fixed lexicographical order.
Nevertheless we also define the smallest relation guaranteeing
lexicographical minimality of a given word (in its conjugacy class).</description>

Graph lemma quantifies the defect effect of a system of word
equations. That is, it provides an upper bound on the rank of the
system. We formalize the proof based on the decomposition of a
solution into its free basis. A direct application is an alternative
proof of the fact that two noncommuting words form a code.</description>
