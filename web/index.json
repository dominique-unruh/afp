We view sorted sets just as partial maps from elements to sorts, and define sorted set of terms reusing the data type from the existing library of (unsorted) first order terms. All the existing functionality, such as substitutions and contexts, can be reused without any modifications. We provide predicates stating what substitutions or contexts are considered sorted, and prove facts that they preserve sorts as expected.",

We verify a recent (abstract) decision procedure for pattern completeness that covers the general case, i.e., in particular without the usual restriction of left-linearity. In two refinement steps, we further develop an executable version of that abstract algorithm. On our example suite, this verified implementation is faster than other implementations that are based on alternative (unverified) approaches, including the complement algorithm, tree automata encodings, and even the pattern completeness check of the GHC Haskell compiler.",

  "abstract": "The top-down solver (TD) is a local and generic fixpoint algorithm used for abstract interpretation. Being local means it only evaluates equations required for the computation of the value of some initially queried unknown, while being generic means that it is applicable for arbitrary equation systems where right-hand sides are considered as black-box functions. To avoid unnecessary evaluations of right-hand sides, the TD collects stable unknowns that need not be re-evaluated. This optimization requires the additional tracking of dependencies between unknowns and a non-local destabilization mechanism to assure the re-evaluation of previously stable unknowns that were affected by a changed value. Due to the recursive evaluation strategy and the non-local destabilization mechanism of the TD, its correctness is non-obvious. To provide a formal proof of its partial correctness, we employ the insight that the TD can be considered an optimized version of a considerably simpler recursive fixpoint algorithm. Following this insight, we first prove the partial correctness of the simpler recursive fixpoint algorithm, the plain TD. Then, we transfer the statement of partial correctness to the TD by establishing the equivalence of both algorithms concerning both their termination behavior and their computed result.",

  "abstract": "The scope of information flow control via static type systems is in principle much broader than information flow security, since this concept promises to cope with information flow correctness in full generality. Such a correctness policy can be expressed by extending the notion of a single stateless level-based interference relation applying throughout a program -- addressed by the static security type systems described by Volpano, Smith, and Irvine, and formalized in Nipkow and Klein's book on formal programming language semantics (in the version of February 2023) -- to that of a stateful interference function mapping program states to (generally) intransitive interference relations.  This paper studies information flow control via stateful intransitive noninterference. First, the notion of termination-sensitive information flow security with respect to a level-based interference relation is generalized to that of termination-sensitive information flow correctness with respect to such a correctness policy. Then, a static type system is specified and is proven to be capable of enforcing such policies. Finally, the information flow correctness notion and the static type system introduced here are proven to degenerate to the counterparts formalized in Nipkow and Klein's book in case of a stateless level-based information flow correctness policy. Although the operational semantics of the didactic programming language IMP employed in the book is used for this purpose, the introduced concepts apply to larger, real-world imperative programming languages as well.",

  "abstract": "The sumcheck protocol, first introduced in 1992, is an interactive proof which is a key component of many probabilistic proof systems in computational complexity theory and cryptography, some of which have been deployed. We provide a formally verified security analysis of the sumcheck protocol, following a general and modular approach.  First, we give a general formalization of public-coin interactive proofs. We then define a generalized sumcheck protocol for which we axiomatize the underlying mathematical structure and we establish its soundness and completeness. Finally, we prove that these axioms hold for multivariate polynomials, the original setting of the sumcheck protocol. Our modular analysis will facilitate formal verification of sumcheck instances based on different mathematical structures with little effort, by simply proving that these structures satisfy the axioms. Moreover, the analysis will encourage the development and formal verification of future probabilistic proof systems using the sumcheck protocol as a building block.  The paper presenting this formalization is to appear at CSF 2024 under the title ``Formal Verification of the Sumcheck Protocol''.",

Thus, it is promising to integrate interval analysis into program verification environments. Such an integration is not only useful for the verification of numerical algorithms: the need to ensure that computations stay within certain bounds is common. For example to show that computations stay within the hardware bounds of a given number representation.  Another application is the verification of cyber-physical systems, where a discretised implementation approximates a system described in physical quantities expressed using perfect mathematical reals, and perfect ordinary differential equations.  In this AFP entry, we formalise extended interval analysis,  including the concept of inclusion isotone (or inclusion isotonic) (extended) interval analysis. The main result is the formal proof that interval-splitting converges for Lipschitz-continuous interval isotone functions. From pragmatic perspective, we provide the datatypes and theory required for integrating interval analysis into other formalisations and applications.",

  "abstract": "Recently, a modern version of Roscoe and Brookes Failure-Divergence Semantics for CSP has been formalized in Isabelle (HOL-CSP) and extended (HOL-CSPM). The resulting framework is purely denotational and, given the possibility to define arbitrary events in a HOL-type, more expressive than the original.  However, there is a need for an operational semantics for CSP. From the latter, model-checkers, symbolic execution engines for test-case generators, and animators and simulators can be constructed. In the literature, a few versions of operational semantics for CSP have been proposed, where it is assumed, of course, that denotational and operational constructs coincide, but this is not obvious at first glance.  The present work addresses this issue by providing the first (to our knowledge) formal theory of operational behavior derived from HOL-CSP via a bridge definition between the denotational and the operational semantics. In fact, several possibilities are discussed.  As a bonus, we have defined three new operators: Sliding, Throw and Interrupt which are of particular pragmatic interest in operational semantics. Moreover, we have proven new laws for HOL-CSP improving the latter.",

The correctness proof is expanded to cover both the deterministic part from the previous formalization and the probabilistic part of randomly chosen inputs. Indeed, the probabilistic version of the delta-correctness in the original paper was flawed and could only be formalized for a modified delta'.  The authors of Kyber also remarked, that the security proof against indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack (IND-CPA) does not hold for the original version of Kyber. Thus, the newer version (round 2 and 3 of NIST standarisation process) was formalized as well, including the adapted deterministic and probabilistic correctness theorems. Moreover, the IND-CPA security proof against the new version of Kyber has been verified using the CryptHOL library. Since the new version also included a change of parameters, the Kyber algorithms have been instantiated with the new parameter set as well.",

Notably, this encompasses all fields of characteristic 0 and all finite fields.  For fields with characteristic 0, the ERF algorithm proceeds similarly to the classical Yun algorithm.  However, for fields with non-zero characteristic \u003ci\u003ep\u003c/i\u003e, Yun's algorithm can fail because the derivative of a non-zero polynomial can be 0. The ERF algorithm detects this case and therefore also works in this more general setting.  To state the ERF Algorithm in this general form, we build on the entry on perfect fields. We show that the ERF algorithm is correct and returns a list of pairwise coprime square-free polynomials whose product is the input polynomial. Indeed, through this, the ERF algorithm also yields executable code for calculating the square-free part of a polynomial (denoted by the function \u003cem\u003eradical\u003c/em\u003e).",

  "abstract": "In this project, we present a peculiar construction of the real numbers, called \"Eudoxus reals\", using Isabelle/HOL. Similar to the classical method of Dedekind cuts, our approach starts from first principles. However, unlike Dedekind cuts, Eudoxus reals directly derive real numbers from integers, bypassing the intermediate step of constructing rational numbers.  This construction of the real numbers was first discovered by Stephen Schanuel. Schanuel named his construction after the ancient Greek philosopher Eudoxus, who developed a theory of magnitude and proportion to explain the relations between the discrete and the continuous. Our formalization is based on R.D. Arthan's paper detailing the construction. For establishing the existence of multiplicative inverses for positive slopes, we used the idea of finding a suitable representative from S\u0026#x0142;awomir Ko\u0026#x0142;ody\u0026#x0144;aski's construction on IsarMathLib which is based on Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory.

  "abstract": "This library includes several example applications of the probabilistic method for combinatorics to establish bounds for hypergraph colourings. This focuses on Property B - the existence of a two-colouring of the vertex set of a hypergraph. A stricter bound was formalised using the Lov\u0026aacutesz local lemma, which in turn required a surprisingly complex proof of the mutual independence principle for hypergraph edges that is often omitted on paper. The formalisation uncovered several interesting examples of circular intuition on proofs involving independence on paper. The formalisation is based on the textbook proofs from Alon and Spencer's famous textbook, \u003cem\u003eThe Probabilistic Method\u003c/em\u003e, further supported by notes by Zhao. The mutual independence principle proof is inspired by the less precise proof provided in Molloy and Reed's textbook on graph colourings, as it was omitted in all other sources. Additionally, this library demonstrates how locales can be used to establish a reusable probability space framework, thus minimizing the setup required for future formalisations requiring a probability space on numerous possible properties around an incidence system's vertex set.",

The formalisation focuses on the general lemma, however also proves several useful variations, including the more well-known symmetric version. Both the original formalisation and several of the variations used dependency graphs, which were formalised using Noschinski's general directed graph library. Additionally, the entry provides several useful existence lemmas, required at the end of most probabilistic proofs on combinatorial structures. Finally, the entry includes several significant extensions to the existing probability libraries, particularly for conditional probability (such as Bayes theorem) and independent events. The formalisation is primarily based on Alon and Spencer's textbook \"The Probabilistic Method\", as well as Zhao's course notes on the subject.",

Both designs and hypergraphs are types of incidence set systems and hence have the same underlying foundation. However, they are often used in different contexts, and some definitions are unique. This library uses locales to rewrite equivalent definitions and build a basic hypergraph hierarchy with direct links to equivalent design theory concepts to avoid repetition, further demonstrating the power of the \"locale-centric\" approach. The library includes all standard definitions (order, degree etc.), as well as some extensions on hypergraph decompositions and spanning subhypergraphs.",

  "abstract": "Euler stated in 1752 that every convex polyhedron satisfied the formula $V - E + F = 2$  where $V$, $E$ and $F$ are the numbers of its vertices, edges, and faces. For three dimensions, the well-known proof involves removing one face and then flattening the remainder to form a planar graph, which then is iteratively transformed to leave a single triangle. The history of that proof is extensively discussed and elaborated by Imre Lakatos, leaving one finally wondering whether the theorem even holds. The formal proof provided here has been ported from HOL Light,  where it is credited to Lawrence. The proof generalises Euler's observation from solid polyhedra to convex polytopes of arbitrary dimension.",

More specifically, in catoids,   the partial composition of arrows in a category is generalised to a   multioperation, which sends pairs of elements to sets of elements,   and the definedness condition of arrow composition -- two arrows can   be composed if and only the target of the first matches the source   of the second -- is relaxed. Beyond a library of basic laws for   catoids, single-set categories and groupoids, I formalise the facts   that every catoid can be lifted to a modal powerset quantale, that   every groupoid can be lifted to a Dedekind quantale and to power set   relation algebras, a special case of a famous result of Jónsson and   Tarski. Finally, I show that single-set categories are equivalent to   a standard axiomatisation of categories based on a set of objects   and a set of arrows, and compare catoids with related structures   such as multimonoid and relational monoids (monoids in the monoidal   category Rel).",

This can be employed to avoid carrying around length constraints on lists. Instead, those constraints are discharged by the type checker.

We do two things to achieve this.  First, in addition to translating a standard, we provide a robust supporting theory that proves anything that one might wish to know about the primitives that the standard defines.  For example, we prove that encryption and decryption are inverse  operations.  We prove when RSA keys are equivalent.  We prove that if a message is signed, then that signature and message will pass the verification operation.  Any fact that you may need in using these standards, we hope and believe we have already proved for you.  \u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp class=MsoNormal\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp class=MsoNormal\u003eSecond, we prove (by evaluation) that the test vectors provided by NIST, et al, check as intended (whether a passing or failing test case.)  The test vectors may be found in theories named *_Test_Vectors.thy.  These files can be large and take time for Isabelle to process.  Thus, they are not imported by this main Crypto_Standards theory.  Users may open those separately.  As an aside, Isabelle must be told how to compute certain operations efficiently.  For example, modular exponentiation or scalar multiplication of a point on an elliptic curve.  The Efficient*.thy files are necessary to check the test vectors.  \u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp class=MsoNormal\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp class=MsoNormal\u003eWe attempt to be as agnostic to implementation details as possible.  For example, we do not  assume any particular data type has been used as input or output.  Many standards operate on octets, or 8-bit values.  For these theories, an octet string is modeled as a list of natural numbers.  Then a nat x is a \u0026quot;valid octet\u0026quot; exactly when x \u0026lt; 256.  Words.thy contains all the  operations needed to convert natural number to a string of n-bit values and back to a natural number.  There you will also find definitions for handling padding and bit manipulations that are found in the above standards.  Again, we believe that we have proved anything you may need to apply these theories.  We have erred on the side of including lemmas that may be of practical use as opposed to proving a minimal set of lemmas required.  \u003c/p\u003e  \u003c/div\u003e  \u003c/body\u003e  \u003c/html\u003e",

In this paper, we formalize some results on directed sets in Isabelle/HOL, most notably: under the axiom of choice, a poset has a supremum for every directed set if and only if it does so for every chain; and a function between such posets preserves suprema of directed sets if and only if it preserves suprema of chains. The known pen-and-paper proofs of these results crucially use uncountable transfinite sequences, which are not directly implementable in Isabelle/HOL. We show how to emulate such proofs by utilizing Isabelle/HOL's ordinal and cardinal library. Thanks to the formalization, we relax some conditions for the above results.\u003c/p\u003e",

  "abstract": "We provide an Isabelle verification that the Halting Problem can be solved in Malament-Hogarth (MH) spacetimes. Our proof is quite general -- rather than assume the full machinery of general relativity, we only assume the existence of a reachability relation defined on an abstract space of locations. An MH spacetime can then be described as a space in which there exists an unboundedly long path together with a location which is reachable from all points on that path. Likewise, we use a very general notion of computation - the current state of a computation is assumed to be representable as a machine configuration containing all the information required to determine how the system changes with the execution of each ensuing instruction. The program is deemed to halt if the system enters a stable configuration. Since this situation is generally detectable by an operating system, we can use its occurrence to trigger events that exploit the nature of MH spacetimes, thereby enabling us to detect whether or not halting will eventually have occurred. Our verification follows existing arguments in the literature, albeit translated into this more general setting.",

  "abstract": "The CHSH inequality, named after Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt, was used by Alain Aspect to prove experimentally that Einstein's hypothesis stating that quantum mechanics could be defined using local hidden variables was incorrect.  The CHSH inequality is based on a setting in which an experiment consisting of two separate parties performing joint measurements is run several times, and a score is derived from these runs. If the local hidden variable hypothesis had been correct, this score would have been bounded by $2$, but a suitable choice of observables in a quantum setting permits to violate this inequality when measuring the Bell state; this is the result that Aspect obtained experimentally. Tsirelson answered the question of how large this violation could be by proving that in the quantum setting, the highest score that can be obtained when running this experiment is $2\\sqrt{2}$. Along with elementary results on density matrices which represent quantum states in the finite dimensional setting, we formalize Tsirelson's result and summarize the main results on the CHSH score: \u003col\u003e \u003cli\u003eUnder the local hidden variable hypothesis, this score admits 2 as an upper-bound.\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eWhen the density matrix under consideration is separable, the upper-bound cannot be violated.\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eWhen one of the parties in the experiment performs measures using commuting observables, this upper-bound remains valid.\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eOtherwise, the upper-bound of this score is $2\\sqrt{2}$, regardless of the observables that are used and the quantum state that is measured, and\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eThis upper-bound is reached for a suitable choice of observables when measuring the Bell state.\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ol\u003e",

  "abstract": "Hoare logics are proof systems that allow one to formally establish properties of computer programs. Traditional Hoare logics prove properties of individual program executions (such as functional correctness). On the one hand, Hoare logic has been generalized to prove properties of multiple executions of a program (so-called hyperproperties, such as determinism or non-interference). These program logics prove the absence of (bad combinations of) executions. On the other hand, program logics similar to Hoare logic have been proposed to disprove program properties (e.g., Incorrectness Logic), by proving the existence of (bad combinations of) executions. All of these logics have in common that they specify program properties using assertions over a fixed number of states, for instance, a single pre- and post-state for functional properties or pairs of pre- and post-states for non-interference.  In this entry, we formalize Hyper Hoare Logic, a generalization of Hoare logic that lifts assertions to properties of arbitrary sets of states. The resulting logic is simple yet expressive: its judgments can express arbitrary program hyperproperties, a particular class of hyperproperties over the set of terminating executions of a program (including properties of individual program executions). By allowing assertions to reason about sets of states, Hyper Hoare Logic can reason about both the absence and the existence of (combinations of) executions, and, thereby, supports both proving and disproving program (hyper-)properties within the same logic, including hyperproperties that no existing Hoare logic can express. We prove that Hyper Hoare Logic is sound and complete, and demonstrate that it captures important proof principles naturally.",

  "abstract": "\u003cp\u003eInformation flow security ensures that the secret data manipulated by a program does not influence its observable output. Proving information flow security is especially challenging for concurrent programs, where operations on secret data may influence the execution time of a thread and, thereby, the interleaving between threads. Such internal timing channels may affect the observable outcome of a program even if an attacker does not observe execution times. Existing verification techniques for information flow security in concurrent programs attempt to prove that secret data does not influence the relative timing of threads. However, these techniques are often restrictive (for instance because they disallow branching on secret data) and make strong assumptions about the execution platform (ignoring caching, processor instructions with data-dependent execution time, and other common features that affect execution time). \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e In this entry, we formalize and prove the soundness of CommCSL, a novel relational concurrent separation logic for proving secure information flow in concurrent programs that lifts these restrictions and does not make any assumptions about timing behavior. The key idea is to prove that all mutating operations performed on shared data commute, such that different thread interleavings do not influence its final value. Crucially, commutativity is required only for an abstraction of the shared data that contains the information that will be leaked to a public output. Abstract commutativity is satisfied by many more operations than standard commutativity, which makes our technique widely applicable.\u003c/p\u003e",

  "abstract": "\u003cp\u003eIn this work, I provide an abstract framework for proving the completeness of a logical calculus using the synthetic method. The synthetic method is based on maximal consistent saturated sets (MCSs). A set of formulas is consistent (with respect to the calculus) when we cannot derive a contradiction from it. It is maximally consistent when it contains every formula that is consistent with it. For logics where it is relevant, it is saturated when it contains a witness for every existential formula. To prove completeness using these maximal consistent saturated sets, we prove a truth lemma: every formula in an MCS has a satisfying model. Here, Hintikka sets provide a useful stepping stone. These can be seen as characterizations of the MCSs based on simple subformula conditions rather than via the calculus. We then prove that every Hintikka set gives rise to a satisfying model and that MCSs are Hintikka sets. Now, assume a valid formula cannot be derived. Then its negation must be consistent and therefore satisfiable. This contradicts validity and the original formula must be derivable.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003eTo start, I build maximal consistent saturated sets for any logic that satisfies a small set of assumptions. I do this using a transfinite version of Lindenbaum's lemma, which allows me to support languages of any cardinality. I then prove useful abstract results about derivations and refutations as they relate to MCSs. Finally, I show how Hintikka sets can be derived from the logic's semantics, outlining one way to prove the required truth lemma.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003eTo demonstrate the versatility of the framework, I instantiate it with five different examples. The formalization contains soundness and completeness results for: a propositional tableau calculus, a propositional sequent calculus, an axiomatic system for modal logic, a labelled natural deduction system for hybrid logic and a natural deduction system for first-order logic. The tableau example uses custom Hintikka sets based on the calculus, but the other four examples derive them from the semantics in the style of the framework. The hybrid and first-order logic examples rely on saturated MCSs. This places requirements on the cardinalities of their languages to ensure that there are enough witnesses available. In both cases, the type of witnesses must be infinite and have cardinality at least that of the type of propositional/predicate symbols.\u003c/p\u003e",

  "abstract": "We utilize and extend the method of shallow semantic embeddings (SSEs) in classical higher-order logic (HOL) to construct a custom theorem proving environment for abstract objects theory (AOT) on the basis of Isabelle/HOL.  SSEs are a means for universal logical reasoning by translating a target logic to HOL using a representation of its semantics. AOT is a foundational metaphysical theory, developed by Edward Zalta, that explains the objects presupposed by the sciences as abstract objects that reify property patterns. In particular, AOT aspires to provide a philosphically grounded basis for the construction and analysis of the objects of mathematics.  We can support this claim by verifying Uri Nodelman's and Edward Zalta's reconstruction of Frege's theorem: we can confirm that the Dedekind-Peano postulates for natural numbers are consistently derivable in AOT using Frege's method. Furthermore, we can suggest and discuss generalizations and variants of the construction and can thereby provide theoretical insights into, and contribute to the philosophical justification of, the construction.  In the process, we can demonstrate that our method allows for a nearly transparent exchange of results between traditional pen-and-paper-based reasoning and the computerized implementation, which in turn can retain the automation mechanisms available for Isabelle/HOL.  During our work, we could significantly contribute to the evolution of our target theory itself, while simultaneously solving the technical challenge of using an SSE to implement a theory that is based on logical foundations that significantly differ from the meta-logic HOL.  In general, our results demonstrate the fruitfulness of the practice of Computational Metaphysics, i.e. the application of computational methods to metaphysical questions and theories.",

The proof is of great mathematical interest given that it involves an interplay between different mathematical areas, namely applications of graph theory and probability theory to additive combinatorics involving algebraic objects.

We demonstrate how locales, Isabelle’s module system, can be employed to handle such interplays.

Secondly this library also presents a locale-centric approach, enabling more concise, flexible, and reusable modelling of different types of graphs. Using this approach enables easy links to be made with more expansive formalisations of other combinatorial structures, such as incidence systems, as well as various types of formal representations of graphs.

  "abstract": "The relational calculus (RC), i.e., first-order logic with equality but without function symbols, is a concise, declarative database query language. In contrast to relational algebra or SQL, which are the traditional query languages of choice in the database community, RC queries can evaluate to an infinite relation. Moreover, even in cases where the evaluation result of an RC query would be finite it is not clear how to efficiently compute it. Safe-range RC is an interesting syntactic subclass of RC, because all safe-range queries evaluate to a finite result and it is \u003ca href=\"http://webdam.inria.fr/Alice/pdfs/Chapter-5.pdf\"\u003ewell-known\u003c/a\u003e how to evaluate such queries by translating them to relational algebra.

Assuming an infinite domain, the two queries have the following meaning: The first is closed and characterizes the original query's relative safety, i.e., whether given a fixed database (interpretation of atomic predicates with finite relations), the original query evaluates to a finite relation. The second safe-range query is equivalent to the original query, if the latter is relatively safe.  The formalization uses the Refinement Framework to go from the non-deterministic algorithm described in the paper to a deterministic, executable query translation. Our executable query translation is a first step towards a verified tool that efficiently evaluates arbitrary RC queries. This very problem is also solved by the AFP entry \u003ca href=\"https://isa-afp.org/entries/Eval_FO.html\"\u003eEval_FO\u003c/a\u003e with a theoretically incomparable but practically worse time complexity.

The system allows one party to lend money at 0\u0026percnt; APY to another party in exchange for a good or service. On every update of the ledger, accounts have interest distributed to them. Holders of lent assets keep interest accrued by those assets. After distributing interest, the system returns a fixed fraction of each loan. These fixed fractions determine \u003cem\u003eloan periods\u003c/em\u003e. Loans for longer periods have a smaller fixed fraction returned. Loans may be re-lent or used as collateral for other loans. We give a sufficient criterion to enforce that all accounts will forever be solvent. We give a protocol for maintaining this invariant when transferring or lending funds. We also show that this invariant holds after an update. Even though the system does not track counter-party obligations, we show that all credited and debited loans cancel, and the monetary supply grows at a specified interest rate.",

  "abstract": "Many separation logics support fractional permissions to distinguish between read and write access to a heap location, for instance, to allow concurrent reads while enforcing exclusive writes. Fractional permissions extend to composite assertions such as (co)inductive predicates and magic wands by allowing those to be multiplied by a fraction. Typical separation logic proofs require that this multiplication has three key properties: it needs to distribute over assertions, it should permit fractions to be factored out from assertions, and two fractions of the same assertion should be combinable into one larger fraction.  Existing formal semantics incorporating fractional assertions into a separation logic define multiplication semantically (via models), resulting in a semantics in which distributivity and combinability do not hold for key resource assertions such as magic wands, and fractions cannot be factored out from a separating conjunction. By contrast, existing automatic separation logic verifiers define multiplication syntactically, resulting in a different semantics for which it is unknown whether distributivity and combinability hold for all assertions.  In this entry (which accompanies an \u003ca href=\"https://dardinier.me/papers/multiplication.pdf\"\u003eOOPSLA'22 paper\u003c/a\u003e), we present and formalize an unbounded version of separation logic, a novel semantics for separation logic assertions that allows states to hold more than a full permission to a heap location during the evaluation of an assertion. By reimposing upper bounds on the permissions held per location at statement boundaries, we retain key properties of separation logic, in particular, we prove that the frame rule still holds. We also prove that our assertion semantics unifies semantic and syntactic multiplication and thereby reconciles the discrepancy between separation logic theory and tools and enjoys distributivity, factorisability, and combinability.",

  "abstract": "After introducing the didactic imperative programming language IMP, Nipkow and Klein's book on formal programming language semantics (version of March 2021) specifies compilation of IMP commands into a lower-level language based on a stack machine, and expounds a formal verification of that compiler. Exercise 8.4 asks the reader to adjust such proof for a new compilation target, consisting of a machine language that (i) accesses memory locations through their addresses instead of variable names, and (ii) maintains a stack in memory via a stack pointer rather than relying upon a built-in stack. A natural strategy to maximize reuse of the original proof is keeping the original language as an assembly one and splitting compilation into multiple steps, namely a source-to-assembly step matching the original compilation process followed by an assembly-to-machine step. In this way, proving assembly code-machine code equivalence is the only extant task.  A previous paper by the present author introduces a reasoning toolbox that allows for a compiler correctness proof shorter than the book's one, as such promising to constitute a further enhanced reference for the formal verification of real-world compilers. This paper in turn shows that such toolbox can be reused to accomplish the aforesaid task as well, which demonstrates that the proposed approach also promotes proof reuse in multi-stage compiler verifications.",

For each packet, the sending end host selects an authorized path and embeds it and its authenticators in the packet header. This allows routers to efficiently determine how to forward the packet. The central security property of the data plane, i.e., of forwarding, is that packets can only travel along authorized paths. This property, which we call \u003cem\u003epath authorization\u003c/em\u003e, protects the routing policies of autonomous systems from malicious senders.  The fundamental role of packet forwarding in the Internet's ecosystem and the complexity of the authentication mechanisms employed call for a formal analysis. We develop IsaNet, a parameterized verification framework for data plane protocols in Isabelle/HOL. We first formulate an abstract model without an attacker for which we prove path authorization. We then refine this model by introducing a Dolev--Yao attacker and by protecting authorized paths using (generic) cryptographic validation fields. This model is parametrized by the path authorization mechanism and assumes five simple verification conditions. We propose novel attacker models and different sets of assumptions on the underlying routing protocol. We validate our framework by instantiating it with nine concrete protocols variants and prove that they each satisfy the verification conditions (and hence path authorization). The invariants needed for the security proof are proven in the parametrized model instead of the instance models. Our framework thus supports low-effort security proofs for data plane protocols. In contrast to what could be achieved with state-of-the-art automated protocol verifiers, our results hold for arbitrary network topologies and sets of authorized paths.",

The concept has been generalized to fractional assertions. $A^p$ (where $A$ is a separation logic assertion and $p$ a fraction between $0$ and $1$) represents a fraction $p$ of $A$. $A^p$ holds in a state $\\sigma$ iff there exists a state $\\sigma_A$ in which $A$ holds and $\\sigma$ is obtained from $\\sigma_A$ by multiplying all permission amounts held by $p$.  While $A^{p + q}$ can always be split into $A^p * A^q$, recombining $A^p * A^q$ into $A^{p+q}$ is not always sound.

Using the residuation operation, one can express nuances, such as a distinction between nondeterministic and concurrent choice, as well as partial commutativity relationships between transitions, which are not captured by ordinary transition systems. A version of residuated transition systems was introduced in previous work by the author, in which they were called “concurrent transition systems” in view of the original motivation for their definition from the study of concurrency. In the first part of the present article, we give a formal development that generalizes and subsumes the original presentation. We give an axiomatic definition of residuated transition systems that assumes only a single partial binary operation as given structure. From the axioms, we derive notions of “arrow“ (transition), “source”, “target”, “identity”, as well as “composition” and “join” of transitions; thereby recovering structure that in the previous work was assumed as given. We formalize and generalize the result, that residuation extends from transitions to transition paths, and we systematically develop the properties of this extension. A significant generalization made in the present work is the identification of a general notion of congruence on RTS’s, along with an associated quotient construction. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e In the second part of this article, we use the RTS framework to formalize several results in the theory of reduction in Church’s λ-calculus. Using a de Bruijn index-based syntax in which terms represent parallel reduction steps, we define residuation on terms and show that it satisfies the axioms for an RTS. An application of the results on paths from the first part of the article allows us to prove the classical Church-Rosser Theorem with little additional effort. We then use residuation to define the notion of “development” and we prove the Finite Developments Theorem, that every development is finite, formalizing and adapting to de Bruijn indices a proof by de Vrijer. We also use residuation to define the notion of a “standard reduction path”, and we prove the Standardization Theorem: that every reduction path is congruent to a standard one. As a corollary of the Standardization Theorem, we obtain the Leftmost Reduction Theorem: that leftmost reduction is a normalizing strategy. \u003c/p\u003e",

  "abstract": "We formalize first-order query evaluation over an infinite domain with equality. We first define the syntax and semantics of first-order logic with equality. Next we define a locale \u003ci\u003eeval\u0026lowbar;fo\u003c/i\u003e abstracting a representation of a potentially infinite set of tuples satisfying a first-order query over finite relations. Inside the locale, we define a function \u003ci\u003eeval\u003c/i\u003e checking if the set of tuples satisfying a first-order query over a database (an interpretation of the query's predicates) is finite (i.e., deciding \u003ci\u003erelative safety\u003c/i\u003e) and computing the set of satisfying tuples if it is finite. Altogether the function \u003ci\u003eeval\u003c/i\u003e solves \u003ci\u003ecapturability\u003c/i\u003e (Avron and Hirshfeld, 1991) of first-order logic with equality. We also use the function \u003ci\u003eeval\u003c/i\u003e to prove a code equation for the semantics of first-order logic, i.e., the function checking if a first-order query over a database is satisfied by a variable assignment.\u003cbr/\u003e We provide an interpretation of the locale \u003ci\u003eeval\u0026lowbar;fo\u003c/i\u003e based on the approach by Ailamazyan et al. A core notion in the interpretation is the active domain of a query and a database that contains all domain elements that occur in the database or interpret the query's constants. We prove the main theorem of Ailamazyan et al. relating the satisfaction of a first-order query over an infinite domain to the satisfaction of this query over a finite domain consisting of the active domain and a few additional domain elements (outside the active domain) whose number only depends on the query. In our interpretation of the locale \u003ci\u003eeval\u0026lowbar;fo\u003c/i\u003e, we use a potentially higher number of the additional domain elements, but their number still only depends on the query and thus has no effect on the data complexity (Vardi, 1982) of query evaluation. Our interpretation yields an \u003ci\u003eexecutable\u003c/i\u003e function \u003ci\u003eeval\u003c/i\u003e. The time complexity of \u003ci\u003eeval\u003c/i\u003e on a query is linear in the total number of tuples in the intermediate relations for the subqueries. Specifically, we build a database index to evaluate a conjunction. We also optimize the case of a negated subquery in a conjunction. Finally, we export code for the infinite domain of natural numbers.",

We demonstrate it on the standard logistic function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$ and also reproduce the example analytic function $f(x) = \\frac{e^x}{\\sqrt{sin(x)^3 + cos(x)^3}}$ used for demonstration by Fike and Alonso.\u003c/p\u003e",

These instructions include various moves, arithmetic/logical operations, jumps, call/return, SIMD extensions and others. External functions are supported by allowing a user to provide custom semantics for these calls. Floating-point operations are mapped to uninterpreted functions. The model provides semantics for register aliasing and a byte-level little-endian memory model. The semantics are purposefully incomplete, but overapproximative. For example, the precise effect of flags may be undefined for certain instructions, or instructions may simply have no semantics at all. In those cases, the semantics are mapped to universally quantified uninterpreted terms from a locale. Second, this entry provides a method to symbolic execution of basic blocks. The method, called “\u003ctt\u003ese_step\u003c/tt\u003e” (for: symbolic execution step) fetches an instruction and updates the current symbolic state while keeping track of assumptions made over the memory model. A key component is a set of theorems that prove how reads from memory resolve after writes have occurred.

A couple small and explanatory examples are included, including functions from the word count program.

The Tarski-Seidenberg theorem established that the first-order logic of real arithmetic is decidable by QE. However, in practice, QE algorithms are highly complicated and often combine multiple methods for performance. VS is a practically successful method for QE that targets formulas with low-degree polynomials. To our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize VS for quadratic real arithmetic including inequalities. The proofs necessitate various contributions to the existing multivariate polynomial libraries in Isabelle/HOL. Our framework is modularized and easily expandable (to facilitate integrating future optimizations), and could serve as a basis for developing practical general-purpose QE algorithms. Further, as our formalization is designed with practicality in mind, we export our development to SML and test the resulting code on 378 benchmarks from the literature, comparing to Redlog, Z3, Wolfram Engine, and SMT-RAT. This identified inconsistencies in some tools, underscoring the significance of a verified approach for the intricacies of real arithmetic.",

The completeness proof is in the Henkin style where a consistent set is extended to a maximal consistent set using Lindenbaum's construction and Henkin witnesses are added during the construction to ensure saturation as well. The resulting set is a Hintikka set which, by the model existence theorem, is satisfiable in the Herbrand universe.

  "abstract": "We define the weighted path order (WPO) and formalize several properties such as strong normalization, the subterm property, and closure properties under substitutions and contexts. Our definition of WPO extends the original definition by also permitting multiset comparisons of arguments instead of just lexicographic extensions. Therefore, our WPO not only subsumes lexicographic path orders (LPO), but also recursive path orders (RPO). We formally prove these subsumptions and therefore all of the mentioned properties of WPO are automatically transferable to LPO and RPO as well. Such a transformation is not required for Knuth\u0026ndash;Bendix orders (KBO), since they have already been formalized. Nevertheless, we still provide a proof that WPO subsumes KBO and thereby underline the generality of WPO.",

This paper illustrates how logging-independent message anonymity can be formalized according to the relational method for formal protocol verification by considering a real-world protocol, namely the Restricted Identification one by the BSI.

This formalisation presents a general library for formal reasoning on incidence set systems, designs and their applications, including formal definitions and proofs for many key properties, operations, and theorems on the construction and existence of designs. Notably, this includes formalising t-designs, balanced incomplete block designs (BIBD), group divisible designs (GDD), pairwise balanced designs (PBD), design isomorphisms, and the relationship between graphs and designs. A locale-centric approach has been used to manage the relationships between the many different types of designs. Theorems of particular interest include the necessary conditions for existence of a BIBD, Wilson's construction on GDDs, and Bose's inequality on resolvable designs. Parts of this formalisation are explored in the paper \"A Modular First Formalisation of Combinatorial Design Theory\", presented at CICM 2021.",

  "abstract": "This article formalises the proof of Van der Waerden's Theorem from Ramsey theory.  Van der Waerden's Theorem states that for integers $k$ and $l$ there exists a number $N$ which guarantees that if an integer interval of length at least $N$ is coloured with $k$ colours, there will always be an arithmetic progression of length $l$ of the same colour in said interval. The proof goes along the lines of \\cite{Swan}.  The smallest number $N_{k,l}$ fulfilling Van der Waerden's Theorem is then called the Van der Waerden Number. Finding the Van der Waerden Number is still an open problem for most values of $k$ and $l$.",

The presented proof does not depend on language determinism, so that the proposed approach can be applied to non-deterministic languages as well. As a confirmation, this paper extends IMP with an additional non-deterministic choice command, and proves compiler correctness, viz. the simulation of compiled code execution by source code, for such extended language.",

We provide additional properties related to prefix, suffix, factor, length and rotation. The topics include prefix and suffix comparability, mismatch, word power, total and reversed morphisms, border, periods, primitivity and roots. We also formalize basic, mostly folklore results related to word equations: equidivisibility, commutation and conjugation. Slightly advanced properties include the Periodicity lemma (often cited as the Fine and Wilf theorem) and the variant of the Lyndon-Schützenberger theorem for words, including its full parametric solution. We support the algebraic point of view which sees words as generators of submonoids of a free monoid. This leads to the concepts of the (free) hull, the (free) basis (or code).

The characterisation might be used for deriving approximative safety properties to be targeted by static analyses or checked at runtime.  We utilise a simple yet versatile control flow graph model as a program representation.  As our model is not assumed to be finite it can be instantiated for a broad class of programs.  The targeted security property is indistinguishable security where executions produce sequences of observations and only non-terminating executions are allowed to drop a tail of those.  A very crude approximation of our characterisation is slicing based on program dependence graphs, which we use as a minimal example and derive a corresponding soundness result.

This analysis enables to derive a number of properties that allow to deepen the understanding of these notions, in particular with respect to specification decomposition principles for the case of infinite sets of events. The established relations between the refinement relations help to clarify some obscure points in the CSP literature, but also provide a weapon for shorter refinement proofs. Furthermore, we provide a framework for state-normalisation allowing to formally reason on parameterised process architectures. As a result, we have a modern environment for formal proofs of concurrent systems that allow for the combination of general infinite processes with locally finite ones in a logically safe way. We demonstrate these verification-techniques for classical, generalised examples: The CopyBuffer for arbitrary data and the Dijkstra's Dining Philosopher Problem of arbitrary size.",

Both the ISQ and the SI are deeply integrated into Isabelle's type system. Quantities are parameterised by dimension types, which correspond to base vectors, and thus only quantities of the same dimension can be equated. Since the underlying \"algebra of quantities\" induces congruences on quantity and SI types, specific tactic support is developed to capture these. Our construction is validated by a test-set of known equivalences between both quantities and SI units. Moreover, the presented theory can be used for type-safe conversions between the SI system and others, like the British Imperial System (BIS).",

  "abstract": "In this AFP entry, we formalize the core of the Safely Composable Document Object Model (SC DOM). The SC DOM improve the standard DOM (as formalized in the AFP entry “Core DOM”) by strengthening the tree boundaries set by shadow roots: in the SC DOM, the shadow root is a sub-class of the document class (instead of a base class). This modifications also results in changes to some API methods (e.g., getOwnerDocument) to return the nearest shadow root rather than the document root. As a result, many API methods that, when called on a node inside a shadow tree, would previously “break out” and return or modify nodes that are possibly outside the shadow tree, now stay within its boundaries. This change in behavior makes programs that operate on shadow trees more predictable for the developer and allows them to make more assumptions about other code accessing the DOM.",

Building on this, we define the direct subsumption relation, which lifts the subsumption in context relation to EFSM level such that we can use it to determine whether it is safe to merge a given pair of transitions. Key proofs include the conditions necessary for subsumption to occur and that subsumption and direct subsumption are preorder relations.  We also provide a number of different heuristics which can be used to abstract away concrete values into registers so that more states and transitions can be merged and provide proofs of the various conditions which must hold for these abstractions to subsume their ungeneralised counterparts.

  "abstract": "\u003cp\u003e This entry formalizes some classical concepts and results from inductive inference of recursive functions. In the basic setting a partial recursive function (\"strategy\") must identify (\"learn\") all functions from a set (\"class\") of recursive functions. To that end the strategy receives more and more values $f(0), f(1), f(2), \\ldots$ of some function $f$ from the given class and in turn outputs descriptions of partial recursive functions, for example, Gödel numbers. The strategy is considered successful if the sequence of outputs (\"hypotheses\") converges to a description of $f$. A class of functions learnable in this sense is called \"learnable in the limit\". The set of all these classes is denoted by LIM. \u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003e Other types of inference considered are finite learning (FIN), behaviorally correct learning in the limit (BC), and some variants of LIM with restrictions on the hypotheses: total learning (TOTAL), consistent learning (CONS), and class-preserving learning (CP). The main results formalized are the proper inclusions $\\mathrm{FIN} \\subset \\mathrm{CP} \\subset \\mathrm{TOTAL} \\subset \\mathrm{CONS} \\subset \\mathrm{LIM} \\subset \\mathrm{BC} \\subset 2^{\\mathcal{R}}$, where $\\mathcal{R}$ is the set of all total recursive functions.  Further results show that for all these inference types except CONS, strategies can be assumed to be total recursive functions; that all inference types but CP are closed under the subset relation between classes; and that no inference type is closed under the union of classes. \u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003e The above is based on a formalization of recursive functions heavily inspired by the \u003ca href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Universal_Turing_Machine.html\"\u003eUniversal Turing Machine\u003c/a\u003e entry by Xu et al., but different in that it models partial functions with codomain \u003cem\u003enat option\u003c/em\u003e.

  "abstract": "Binary relations are one of the standard ways to encode, characterise and reason about graphs. Relation algebras provide equational axioms for a large fragment of the calculus of binary relations. Although relations are standard tools in many areas of mathematics and computing, researchers usually fall back to point-wise reasoning when it comes to arguments about paths in a graph. We present a purely algebraic way to specify different kinds of paths in Kleene relation algebras, which are relation algebras equipped with an operation for reflexive transitive closure. We study the relationship between paths with a designated root vertex and paths without such a vertex. Since we stay in first-order logic this development helps with mechanising proofs. To demonstrate the applicability of the algebraic framework we verify the correctness of three basic graph algorithms.",

  "abstract": "This work presents a formal proof in Isabelle/HOL of an algorithm to transform a matrix into its Smith normal form, a canonical matrix form, in a general setting: the algorithm is parameterized by operations to prove its existence over elementary divisor rings, while execution is guaranteed over Euclidean domains. We also provide a formal proof on some results about the generality of this algorithm as well as the uniqueness of the Smith normal form.  Since Isabelle/HOL does not feature dependent types, the development is carried out switching conveniently between two different existing libraries: the Hermite normal form (based on HOL Analysis) and the Jordan normal form AFP entries. This permits to reuse results from both developments and it is done by means of the lifting and transfer package together with the use of local type definitions.",

Both normalisation procedures have a non-elementary worst-case blow-up, and follow an involved path from formulas to counter-free automata to star-free regular expressions and back to formulas. We improve on both points. We present an executable formalisation of a direct and purely syntactic normalisation procedure for LTL yielding a normal form, comparable to the one by Chang, Manna, and Pnueli, that has only a single exponential blow-up.",

Attack Trees are a well established and useful model for the construction of attacks on systems since they allow a stepwise exploration of high level attacks in application scenarios. Using the expressiveness of Higher Order Logic in Isabelle, we develop a generic theory of Attack Trees with a state-based semantics based on Kripke structures and CTL. The resulting framework allows mechanically supported logic analysis of the meta-theory of the proof calculus of Attack Trees and at the same time the developed proof theory enables application to case studies. A central correctness and completeness result proved in Isabelle establishes a connection between the notion of Attack Tree validity and CTL. The application is illustrated on the example of a healthcare IoT system and GDPR compliance verification.",

  "abstract": "This work is a formalization of soundness and completeness proofs for a Seligman-style tableau system for hybrid logic. The completeness result is obtained via a synthetic approach using maximally consistent sets of tableau blocks. The formalization differs from previous work in a few ways. First, to avoid the need to backtrack in the construction of a tableau, the formalized system has no unnamed initial segment, and therefore no Name rule. Second, I show that the full Bridge rule is admissible in the system. Third, I start from rules restricted to only extend the branch with new formulas, including only witnessing diamonds that are not already witnessed, and show that the unrestricted rules are admissible. Similarly, I start from simpler versions of the @-rules and show that these are sufficient. The GoTo rule is restricted using a notion of potential such that each application consumes potential and potential is earned through applications of the remaining rules. I show that if a branch can be closed then it can be closed starting from a single unit. Finally, Nom is restricted by a fixed set of allowed nominals. The resulting system should be terminating.

Points, lines, congruence of pairs of points, betweenness of triples of points, circles, and isometries are defined within the model.

It is shown that it satisfies its negation and the limiting parallels axiom (which proves it to be a model of hyperbolic geometry).",

  "abstract": "Counting sort is a well-known algorithm that sorts objects of any kind mapped to integer keys, or else to keys in one-to-one correspondence with some subset of the integers (e.g. alphabet letters). However, it is suitable for direct use, viz. not just as a subroutine of another sorting algorithm (e.g. radix sort), only if the key range is not significantly larger than the number of the objects to be sorted. This paper describes a tail-recursive generalization of counting sort making use of a bounded number of counters, suitable for direct use in case of a large, or even infinite key range of any kind, subject to the only constraint of being a subset of an arbitrary linear order. After performing a pen-and-paper analysis of how such algorithm has to be designed to maximize its efficiency, this paper formalizes the resulting generalized counting sort (GCsort) algorithm and then formally proves its correctness properties, namely that (a) the counters' number is maximized never exceeding the fixed upper bound, (b) objects are conserved, (c) objects get sorted, and (d) the algorithm is stable.",

  "abstract": "We present a framework for C code in C11 syntax deeply integrated into the Isabelle/PIDE development environment. Our framework provides an abstract interface for verification back-ends to be plugged-in independently. Thus, various techniques such as deductive program verification or white-box testing can be applied to the same source, which is part of an integrated PIDE document model. Semantic back-ends are free to choose the supported C fragment and its semantics. In particular, they can differ on the chosen memory model or the specification mechanism for framing conditions. Our framework supports semantic annotations of C sources in the form of comments. Annotations serve to locally control back-end settings, and can express the term focus to which an annotation refers. Both the logical and the syntactic context are available when semantic annotations are evaluated. As a consequence, a formula in an annotation can refer both to HOL or C variables. Our approach demonstrates the degree of maturity and expressive power the Isabelle/PIDE sub-system has achieved in recent years. Our integration technique employs Lex and Yacc style grammars to ensure efficient deterministic parsing.  This is the core-module of Isabelle/C; the AFP package for Clean and Clean_wrapper as well as AutoCorres and AutoCorres_wrapper (available via git) are applications of this front-end.",

  "abstract": "Clean is based on a simple, abstract execution model for an imperative target language. “Abstract” is understood in contrast to “Concrete Semantics”; alternatively, the term “shallow-style embedding” could be used. It strives for a type-safe notion of program-variables, an incremental construction of the typed state-space, support of incremental verification, and open-world extensibility of new type definitions being intertwined with the program definitions. Clean is based on a “no-frills” state-exception monad with the usual definitions of bind and unit for the compositional glue of state-based computations. Clean offers conditionals and loops supporting C-like control-flow operators such as break and return. The state-space construction is based on the extensible record package. Direct recursion of procedures is supported. Clean’s design strives for extreme simplicity. It is geared towards symbolic execution and proven correct verification tools. The underlying libraries of this package, however, deliberately restrict themselves to the most elementary infrastructure for these tasks. The package is intended to serve as demonstrator semantic backend for Isabelle/C, or for the test-generation techniques.",

We develop here a theory for a language used to specify the timed coordination of such heterogeneous subsystems by addressing the following issues: \u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ethe behavior of the sub-systems is observed only at a series of discrete instants,\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eevents may occur in different sub-systems at unrelated times, leading to polychronous systems, which do not necessarily have a common base clock,\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ecoordination between subsystems involves causality, so the occurrence of an event may enforce the occurrence of other events, possibly after a certain duration has elapsed or an event has occurred a given number of times,\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ethe domain of time (discrete, rational, continuous...) may be different in the subsystems, leading to polytimed systems,\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ethe time frames of different sub-systems may be related (for instance, time in a GPS satellite and in a GPS receiver on Earth are related although they are not the same).\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e Firstly, a denotational semantics of the language is defined. Then, in order to be able to incrementally check the behavior of systems, an operational semantics is given, with proofs of progress, soundness and completeness with regard to the denotational semantics. These proofs are made according to a setup that can scale up when new operators are added to the language. In order for specifications to be composed in a clean way, the language should be invariant by stuttering (i.e., adding observation instants at which nothing happens). The proof of this invariance is also given.",

We keep our formalization as general as possible: we reprove several well-known results about complete orders, often without any properties of ordering, thus complete non-orders. In particular, we generalize the Knaster–Tarski theorem so that we ensure the existence of a quasi-fixed point of monotone maps over complete non-orders, and show that the set of quasi-fixed points is complete under a mild condition—attractivity—which is implied by either antisymmetry or transitivity. This result generalizes and strengthens a result by Stauti and Maaden. Finally, we recover Kleene’s fixed-point theorem for omega-complete non-orders, again using attractivity to prove that Kleene’s fixed points are least quasi-fixed points.",

This type allows us to define a total supremum function, so types form an upper semilattice. It allows us to define rich expression typing rules in an elegant manner.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Preliminaries Chapter of the theory defines a number of helper lemmas for transitive closures and tuples. It defines also a generic object model independent from OCL. It allows one to use the theory as a reference for formalization of analogous languages.\u003c/p\u003e",

  "abstract": "When verifying a concurrent program, it is usual to assume that memory is sequentially consistent.  However, most modern multiprocessors depend on store buffering for efficiency, and provide native sequential consistency only at a substantial performance penalty.  To regain sequential consistency, a programmer has to follow an appropriate programming discipline. However, na\u0026iuml;ve disciplines, such as protecting all shared accesses with locks, are not flexible enough for building high-performance multiprocessor software.  We present a new discipline for concurrent programming under TSO (total store order, with store buffer forwarding). It does not depend on concurrency primitives, such as locks. Instead, threads use ghost operations to acquire and release ownership of memory addresses. A thread can write to an address only if no other thread owns it, and can read from an address only if it owns it or it is shared and the thread has flushed its store buffer since it last wrote to an address it did not own. This discipline covers both coarse-grained concurrency (where data is protected by locks) as well as fine-grained concurrency (where atomic operations race to memory).  We formalize this discipline in Isabelle/HOL, and prove that if every execution of a program in a system without store buffers follows the discipline, then every execution of the program with store buffers is sequentially consistent. Thus, we can show sequential consistency under TSO by ordinary assertional reasoning about the program, without having to consider store buffers at all.",

One valid completeness threshold is the diameter of the underlying transition system. The diameter is the maximum element in the set of lengths of all shortest paths between pairs of states. The diameter is not calculated exactly in our setting, where the transition system is succinctly described using a (propositionally) factored representation. Rather, an upper bound on the diameter is calculated compositionally, by bounding the diameters of small abstract subsystems, and then composing those.  We port a HOL4 formalisation of a compositional algorithm for computing a relatively tight upper bound on the system diameter. This compositional algorithm exploits acyclicity in the state space to achieve compositionality, and it was introduced by Abdulaziz et. al. The formalisation that we port is described as a part of another paper by Abdulaziz et. al.

When all roots are known to be real, the over-approximation becomes tight: we can utilise this theorem to count real roots exactly. It is also worth noting that Descartes' rule of sign is a direct consequence of the Budan–Fourier theorem, and has been included in this entry. In addition, we have extended previous formalised Sturm's theorem to count real roots with multiplicity, while the original Sturm's theorem only counts distinct real roots.

  "abstract": "Utility functions form an essential part of game theory and economics. In order to guarantee the existence of utility functions most of the time sufficient properties are assumed in an axiomatic manner. One famous and very common set of such assumptions is that of expected utility theory. Here, the rationality, continuity, and independence of preferences is assumed. The von-Neumann-Morgenstern Utility theorem shows that these assumptions are necessary and sufficient for an expected utility function to exists. This theorem was proven by Neumann and Morgenstern in “Theory of Games and Economic Behavior” which is regarded as one of the most influential works in game theory. The formalization includes formal definitions of the underlying concepts including continuity and independence of preferences.",

Our approach is simple but expressive, allowing us to succinctly specify a variety of abstract datatypes, including maps, sets, lists, text, graphs, trees, and registers. Our datatypes are also composable, enabling the construction of complex data structures. To demonstrate the utility of OpSets for analysing replication algorithms, we highlight an important correctness property for collaborative text editing that has traditionally been overlooked; algorithms that do not satisfy this property can exhibit awkward interleaving of text. We use OpSets to specify this correctness property and prove that although one existing replication algorithm satisfies this property, several other published algorithms do not.",

  "abstract": "The following document formalizes and verifies several architectural design patterns. Each pattern specification is formalized in terms of a locale where the locale assumptions correspond to the assumptions which a pattern poses on an architecture. Thus, pattern specifications may build on top of each other by interpreting the corresponding locale. A pattern is verified using the framework provided by the AFP entry Dynamic Architectures. Currently, the document consists of formalizations of 4 different patterns: the singleton, the publisher subscriber, the blackboard pattern, and the blockchain pattern. Thereby, the publisher component of the publisher subscriber pattern is modeled as an instance of the singleton pattern and the blackboard pattern is modeled as an instance of the publisher subscriber pattern. In general, this entry provides the first steps towards an overall theory of architectural design patterns.",

  "abstract": "Short vectors in lattices and factors of integer polynomials are related. Each factor of an integer polynomial belongs to a certain lattice. When factoring polynomials, the condition that we are looking for an irreducible polynomial means that we must look for a small element in a lattice, which can be done by a basis reduction algorithm. In this development we formalize this connection and thereby one main application of the LLL basis reduction algorithm: an algorithm to factor square-free integer polynomials which runs in polynomial time. The work is based on our previous Berlekamp–Zassenhaus development, where the exponential reconstruction phase has been replaced by the polynomial-time basis reduction algorithm. Thanks to this formalization we found a serious flaw in a textbook.",

  "abstract": "The Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovász basis reduction algorithm, also known as LLL algorithm, is an algorithm to find a basis with short, nearly orthogonal vectors of an integer lattice. Thereby, it can also be seen as an approximation to solve the shortest vector problem (SVP), which is an NP-hard problem, where the approximation quality solely depends on the dimension of the lattice, but not the lattice itself. The algorithm also possesses many applications in diverse fields of computer science, from cryptanalysis to number theory, but it is specially well-known since it was used to implement the first polynomial-time algorithm to factor polynomials.

  "abstract": "A geodesic metric space is Gromov hyperbolic if all its geodesic triangles are thin, i.e., every side is contained in a fixed thickening of the two other sides. While this definition looks innocuous, it has proved extremely important and versatile in modern geometry since its introduction by Gromov.  We formalize the basic classical properties of Gromov hyperbolic spaces, notably the Morse lemma asserting that quasigeodesics are close to geodesics, the invariance of hyperbolicity under quasi-isometries, we define and study the Gromov boundary and its associated distance, and prove that a quasi-isometry between Gromov hyperbolic spaces extends to a homeomorphism of the boundaries. We also prove a less classical theorem, by Bonk and Schramm, asserting that a Gromov hyperbolic space embeds isometrically in a geodesic Gromov-hyperbolic space. As the original proof uses a transfinite sequence of Cauchy completions, this is an interesting formalization exercise.  Along the way, we introduce basic material on isometries, quasi-isometries, Lipschitz maps, geodesic spaces, the Hausdorff distance, the Cauchy completion of a metric space, and the exponential on extended real numbers.",

A transition system is typically instantiated by providing a set of initial states, a predicate for enabled transitions, and a transition execution function. From this, it defines the concepts of finite and infinite paths as well as the set of reachable states, among other things. Many useful theorems, from basic path manipulation rules to coinduction and run construction rules, are proven in this abstract transition system context. The library comes with instantiations for DFAs, NFAs, and Büchi automata.",

It thereby serves as a fundamental metaphysical theory that can be used to axiomatize and describe a wide range of philosophical objects, such as Platonic forms or Leibniz' concepts, and has the ambition to function as a foundational theory of mathematics. The target theory of our embedding as described in chapters 7-9 of PLM employs a modal relational type theory as logical foundation for which a representation in functional type theory is \u003ca href=\"https://mally.stanford.edu/Papers/rtt.pdf\"\u003eknown to be challenging\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Nevertheless we arrive at a functioning representation of the theory in the functional logic of Isabelle/HOL based on a semantical representation of an Aczel-model of the theory.

  "abstract": "The architecture of a system describes the system's overall organization into components and connections between those components. With the emergence of mobile computing, dynamic architectures have become increasingly important. In such architectures, components may appear or disappear, and connections may change over time. In the following we mechanize a theory of dynamic architectures and verify the soundness of a corresponding calculus. Therefore, we first formalize the notion of configuration traces as a model for dynamic architectures. Then, the behavior of single components is formalized in terms of behavior traces and an operator is introduced and studied to extract the behavior of a single component out of a given configuration trace. Then, behavior trace assertions are introduced as a temporal specification technique to specify behavior of components. Reasoning about component behavior in a dynamic context is formalized in terms of a calculus for dynamic architectures. Finally, the soundness of the calculus is verified by introducing an alternative interpretation for behavior trace assertions over configuration traces and proving the rules of the calculus. Since projection may lead to finite as well as infinite behavior traces, they are formalized in terms of coinductive lists. Thus, our theory is based on Lochbihler's formalization of coinductive lists. The theory may be applied to verify properties for dynamic architectures.",

  "abstract": "We present a semantics for an applied call-by-value lambda-calculus that is compositional, extensional, and elementary. We present four different views of the semantics: 1) as a relational (big-step) semantics that is not operational but instead declarative, 2) as a denotational semantics that does not use domain theory, 3) as a non-deterministic interpreter, and 4) as a variant of the intersection type systems of the Torino group.  We prove that the semantics is correct by showing that it is sound and complete with respect to operational semantics on programs and that is sound with respect to contextual equivalence. We have not yet investigated whether it is fully abstract. We demonstrate that this approach to semantics is useful with three case studies. First, we use the semantics to prove correctness of a compiler optimization that inlines function application. Second, we adapt the semantics to the polymorphic lambda-calculus extended with general recursion and prove semantic type soundness.

We develop a modular and reusable framework for verifying the correctness of CRDT algorithms. We avoid correctness issues that have dogged previous mechanised proofs in this area by including a network model in our formalisation, and proving that our theorems hold in all possible network behaviours. Our axiomatic network model is a standard abstraction that accurately reflects the behaviour of real-world computer networks. Moreover, we identify an abstract convergence theorem, a property of order relations, which provides a formal definition of strong eventual consistency.

Our refinement strategy transforms abstract security goals into protocols that are secure when operating over an insecure channel controlled by a Dolev-Yao-style intruder. As intermediate levels of abstraction, we employ messageless guard protocols and channel protocols communicating over channels with security properties. These abstractions provide insights on why protocols are secure and foster the development of families of protocols sharing common structure and properties. We have implemented our method in Isabelle/HOL and used it to develop different entity authentication and key establishment protocols, including realistic features such as key confirmation, replay caches, and encrypted tickets. Our development highlights that guard protocols and channel protocols provide fundamental abstractions for bridging the gap between security properties and standard protocol descriptions based on cryptographic messages. It also shows that our refinement approach scales to protocols of nontrivial size and complexity.",

The main theorems formalized are MacLane's coherence theorem and the constructions of the free monoidal category and free strict monoidal category generated by a given category.  The coherence theorem is proved syntactically, using a structurally recursive approach to reduction of terms that might have some novel aspects. We also give proofs of some results given by Etingof et al, which may prove useful in a formal setting. In particular, we show that the left and right unitors need not be taken as given data in the definition of monoidal category, nor does the definition of monoidal functor need to take as given a specific isomorphism expressing the preservation of the unit object.

Internally, this is a sophisticated procedure, because in HOL, case statements are represented as nested calls to the case combinators as generated by the datatype package. Furthermore, the procedure relies on laziness of match expressions in the target language, i.e., that branches guarded by patterns that fail to match are not evaluated. Similarly, \u003ctt\u003eif-then-else\u003c/tt\u003e is printed to the corresponding construct in the target language.

  "abstract": "The concurrent refinement algebra developed here is designed to provide a foundation for rely/guarantee reasoning about concurrent programs. The algebra builds on a complete lattice of commands by providing sequential composition, parallel composition and a novel weak conjunction operator. The weak conjunction operator coincides with the lattice supremum providing its arguments are non-aborting, but aborts if either of its arguments do. Weak conjunction provides an abstract version of a guarantee condition as a guarantee process. We distinguish between models that distribute sequential composition over non-deterministic choice from the left (referred to as being conjunctive in the refinement calculus literature) and those that don't. Least and greatest fixed points of monotone functions are provided to allow recursion and iteration operators to be added to the language. Additional iteration laws are available for conjunctive models. The rely quotient of processes \u003ci\u003ec\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003ei\u003c/i\u003e is the process that, if executed in parallel with \u003ci\u003ei\u003c/i\u003e implements \u003ci\u003ec\u003c/i\u003e.

We have developed a language, PSL, designed to capture high level proof strategies. PSL offloads the construction of human-readable fast-to-replay proof scripts to automatic search, making use of search-time information about each conjecture. Our preliminary evaluations show that PSL reduces the labour cost of interactive theorem proving. This submission contains the implementation of PSL and an example theory file, Example.thy, showing how to write poof strategies in PSL.",

  "abstract": "Paraconsistency is about handling inconsistency in a coherent way. In classical and intuitionistic logic everything follows from an inconsistent theory. A paraconsistent logic avoids the explosion. Quite a few applications in computer science and engineering are discussed in the Intelligent Systems Reference Library Volume 110: Towards Paraconsistent Engineering (Springer 2016). We formalize a paraconsistent many-valued logic that we motivated and described in a special issue on logical approaches to paraconsistency (Journal of Applied Non-Classical Logics 2005). We limit ourselves to the propositional fragment of the higher-order logic. The logic is based on so-called key equalities and has a countably infinite number of truth values. We prove theorems in the logic using the definition of validity. We verify truth tables and also counterexamples for non-theorems. We prove meta-theorems about the logic and finally we investigate a case study.",

  "abstract": "We propose a concurrency reasoning framework for imperative programs, based on the Owicki-Gries (OG) foundational shared-variable concurrency method. Our framework combines the approaches of Hoare-Parallel, a formalisation of OG in Isabelle/HOL for a simple while-language, and Simpl, a generic imperative language embedded in Isabelle/HOL, allowing formal reasoning on C programs. We define the Complx language, extending the syntax and semantics of Simpl with support for parallel composition and synchronisation. We additionally define an OG logic, which we prove sound w.r.t. the  semantics, and a verification condition generator, both supporting involved low-level imperative constructs such as function calls and abrupt termination. We illustrate our framework on an example that features exceptions, guards and function calls.  We aim to then target concurrent operating systems, such as the interruptible eChronos embedded operating system for which we already have a model-level OG proof using Hoare-Parallel.",

  "abstract": "We present a simple model of a firewall. The firewall can accept or drop a packet and can match on interfaces, IP addresses, protocol, and ports. It was designed to feature nice mathematical properties: The type of match expressions was carefully crafted such that the conjunction of two match expressions is only one match expression. This model is too simplistic to mirror all aspects of the real world. In the upcoming entry \"Iptables Semantics\", we will translate the Linux firewall iptables to this model.  For a fixed service (e.g. ssh, http), we provide an algorithm to compute an overview of the firewall's filtering behavior. The algorithm computes minimal service matrices, i.e. graphs which partition the complete IPv4 and IPv6 address space and visualize the allowed accesses between partitions.

  "abstract": "TRACER is a tool for verifying safety properties of sequential C programs. TRACER attempts at building a finite symbolic execution graph which over-approximates the set of all concrete reachable states and the set of feasible paths.  We present an abstract framework for TRACER and similar CEGAR-like systems. The framework provides 1) a graph- transformation based method for reducing the feasible paths in control-flow graphs, 2) a model for symbolic execution, subsumption, predicate abstraction and invariant generation. In this framework we formally prove two key properties: correct construction of the symbolic states and preservation of feasible paths. The framework focuses on core operations, leaving to concrete prototypes to “fit in” heuristics for combining them.

This entry also includes the Imperative Isabelle Collection Framework (IICF), which provides a library of re-usable imperative collection data structures.  Moreover, this entry contains a quickstart guide and a reference manual, which provide an introduction to using the IRF for Isabelle/HOL experts. It also provids a collection of (partly commented) practical examples, some highlights being Dijkstra's Algorithm, Nested-DFS, and a generic worklist algorithm with subsumption.

  "abstract": "This theory is a formalization of the resolution calculus for first-order logic. It is proven sound and complete. The soundness proof uses the substitution lemma, which shows a correspondence between substitutions and updates to an environment. The completeness proof uses semantic trees, i.e. trees whose paths are partial Herbrand interpretations. It employs Herbrand's theorem in a formulation which states that an unsatisfiable set of clauses has a finite closed semantic tree. It also uses the lifting lemma which lifts resolution derivation steps from the ground world up to the first-order world. The theory is presented in a paper in the Journal of Automated Reasoning [Sch18] which extends a paper presented at the International Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving [Sch16].

  "abstract": "\u003cp\u003e This article attempts to develop a usable framework for doing category theory in Isabelle/HOL.  Our point of view, which to some extent differs from that of the previous AFP articles on the subject, is to try to explore how category theory can be done efficaciously within HOL, rather than trying to match exactly the way things are done using a traditional approach.  To this end, we define the notion of category in an \"object-free\" style, in which a category is represented by a single partial composition operation on arrows.  This way of defining categories provides some advantages in the context of HOL, including the ability to avoid the use of records and the possibility of defining functors and natural transformations simply as certain functions on arrows, rather than as composite objects.  We define various constructions associated with the basic notions, including: dual category, product category, functor category, discrete category, free category, functor composition, and horizontal and vertical composite of natural transformations.  A \"set category\" locale is defined that axiomatizes the notion \"category of all sets at a type and all functions between them,\" and a fairly extensive set of properties of set categories is derived from the locale assumptions. The notion of a set category is used to prove the Yoneda Lemma in a general setting of a category equipped with a \"hom embedding,\" which maps arrows of the category to the \"universe\" of the set category.  We also give a treatment of adjunctions, defining adjunctions via left and right adjoint functors, natural bijections between hom-sets, and unit and counit natural transformations, and showing the equivalence of these definitions.  We also develop the theory of limits, including representations of functors, diagrams and cones, and diagonal functors.  We show that right adjoint functors preserve limits, and that limits can be constructed via products and equalizers.  We characterize the conditions under which limits exist in a set category. We also examine the case of limits in a functor category, ultimately culminating in a proof that the Yoneda embedding preserves limits. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Revisions made subsequent to the first version of this article added material on equivalence of categories, cartesian categories, categories with pullbacks, categories with finite limits, and cartesian closed categories.  A construction was given of the category of hereditarily finite sets and functions between them, and it was shown that this category is cartesian closed. Using \"ZFC_in_HOL\", a construction was also given of the (large) category of small sets and functions between them, and it was shown that this category is small-complete. \u003c/p\u003e",

Sulzmann and Lu cleverly extended this algorithm in order to deal with POSIX matching, which is the underlying disambiguation strategy for regular expressions needed in lexers. Their algorithm generates POSIX values which encode the information of how a regular expression matches a string--—that is, which part of the string is matched by which part of the regular expression. In this paper we give our inductive definition of what a POSIX value is and show (i) that such a value is unique (for given regular expression and string being matched) and (ii) that Sulzmann and Lu’s algorithm always generates such a value (provided that the regular expression matches the string). This holds also when optimisations are included. Finally we show that (iii) our inductive definition of a POSIX value is equivalent to an alternative definition by Okui and Suzuki which identifies POSIX values as least elements according to an ordering of values.\u003c/p\u003e",

The completeness proofs take into account the usual redundancy elimination rules (tautology elimination and subsumption), and several refinements of the Resolution rule are considered: ordered resolution (with selection functions), positive and negative resolution, semantic resolution and unit resolution (the latter refinement is complete only for clause sets that are Horn- renamable). We also define a concrete procedure for computing saturated sets and establish its soundness and completeness. The clause sets are not assumed to be finite, so that the results can be applied to formulas obtained by grounding sets of first-order clauses (however, a total ordering among atoms is assumed to be given). Next, we show that the unrestricted Resolution rule is deductive- complete, in the sense that it is able to generate all  (prime) implicates of any set of propositional clauses (i.e., all entailment- minimal, non-valid, clausal consequences of the considered set). The generation of prime implicates is an important problem, with many applications in artificial intelligence and verification (for abductive reasoning, knowledge compilation, diagnosis, debugging etc.). We also show that implicates can be computed in an incremental way, by fixing an ordering among all the atoms in the considered sets and resolving upon these atoms one by one in the considered order (with no backtracking). This feature is critical for the efficient computation of prime implicates. Building on these results, we provide a procedure for computing such implicates and establish its soundness and completeness.",

This work formalizes the theory for the subclass of diagonal-free timed automata,  which is sufficient to model many interesting problems.  We first define the basic concepts and semantics of diagonal-free timed automata.  Based on this, we prove two types of decidability results for the language emptiness problem.    The first is the classic result of Alur and Dill [AD90, AD94],  which uses a finite partitioning of the state space into so-called `regions`.    Our second result focuses on an approach based on `Difference Bound Matrices (DBMs)`,  which is practically used by model checkers.  We prove the correctness of the basic forward analysis operations on DBMs.  One of these operations is the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for the all-pairs shortest paths problem. To obtain a finite search space, a widening operation has to be used for this kind of analysis.  We use Patricia Bouyer's [Bou04] approach to prove that this widening operation  is correct in the sense that DBM-based forward analysis in combination with the widening operation also decides language emptiness. The interesting property of this proof is that the first  decidability result is reused to obtain the second one.",

Compared to the existing approaches of constructing a non-deterministic Buechi-automaton in the first step and then applying a determinization procedure (e.g. some variant of Safra's construction) in a second step, this new approach preservers a relation between the formula and the states of the resulting automaton. While the old approach produced a monolithic structure, the new method is compositional. Furthermore, in some cases the resulting automata are much smaller than the automata generated by existing approaches. In order to ensure the correctness of the construction, this entry contains a complete formalisation and verification of the translation. Furthermore from this basis executable code is generated.",

Along the way, we develop the general theory of groups (relying on the group_add class for the basics), modules, and vector spaces, to the extent required for theory of group representations. We then provide formal proofs of several important introductory theorems in the subject, including Maschke's theorem, Schur's lemma, and Frobenius reciprocity. We also prove that every irreducible representation is isomorphic to a submodule of the group ring, leading to the fact that for a finite group there are only finitely many isomorphism classes of irreducible representations. In all of this, no restriction is made on the characteristic of the ring or field of scalars until the definition of a group representation, and then the only restriction made is that the characteristic must not divide the order of the group.",

  "abstract": "Encodings or the proof of their absence are the main way to compare process calculi. To analyse the quality of encodings and to rule out trivial or meaningless encodings, they are augmented with quality criteria. There exists a bunch of different criteria and different variants of criteria in order to reason in different settings. This leads to incomparable results. Moreover it is not always clear whether the criteria used to obtain a result in a particular setting do indeed fit to this setting. We show how to formally reason about and compare encodability criteria by mapping them on requirements on a relation between source and target terms that is induced by the encoding function. In particular we analyse the common criteria full abstraction, operational correspondence, divergence reflection, success sensitiveness, and respect of barbs; e.g. we analyse the exact nature of the simulation relation (coupled simulation versus bisimulation) that is induced by different variants of operational correspondence. This way we reduce the problem of analysing or comparing encodability criteria to the better understood problem of comparing relations on processes.",

  "abstract": "Algorithms for solving the consensus problem are fundamental to distributed computing. Despite their brevity, their ability to operate in concurrent, asynchronous and failure-prone environments comes at the cost of complex and subtle behaviors. Accordingly, understanding how they work and proving their correctness is a non-trivial endeavor where abstraction is immensely helpful. Moreover, research on consensus has yielded a large number of algorithms, many of which appear to share common algorithmic ideas. A natural question is whether and how these similarities can be distilled and described in a precise, unified way. In this work, we combine stepwise refinement and lockstep models to provide an abstract and unified view of a sizeable family of consensus algorithms. Our models provide insights into the design choices underlying the different algorithms, and classify them based on those choices.",

Several well-established methodologies apply interactive theorem proving to formulate a noninterference theorem over abstract academic models. In joint work with several industrial and academic partners throughout Europe, we are helping in the certification process of PikeOS, an industrial separation kernel developed at SYSGO. In this process, established theories could not be applied. We present a new generic model of separation kernels and a new theory of intransitive noninterference. The model is rich in detail, making it suitable for formal verification of realistic and industrial systems such as PikeOS.

  "abstract": "Stepwise program refinement techniques can be used to simplify program verification. Programs are better understood since their main properties are clearly stated, and verification of rather complex algorithms is reduced to proving simple statements connecting successive program specifications. Additionally, it is easy to analyze similar algorithms and to compare their properties within a single formalization. Usually, formal analysis is not done in educational setting due to complexity of verification and a lack of tools and procedures to make comparison easy. Verification of an algorithm should not only give correctness proof, but also better understanding of an algorithm. If the verification is based on small step program refinement, it can become simple enough to be demonstrated within the university-level computer science curriculum. In this paper we demonstrate this and give a formal analysis of two well known algorithms (Selection Sort and Heap Sort) using proof assistant Isabelle/HOL and program refinement techniques.",

While UML is mostly known as diagrammatic modeling language (e.g., visualizing class models), it is complemented by a textual language, called Object Constraint Language (OCL). The current version of OCL is based on a four-valued logic that turns UML into a formal language. Any type comprises the elements \"invalid\" and \"null\" which are propagated as strict and non-strict, respectively. Unfortunately, the former semi-formal semantics of this specification language, captured in the \"Annex A\" of the OCL standard, leads to different interpretations of corner cases. We formalize the core of OCL: denotational definitions, a logical calculus and operational rules that allow for the execution of OCL expressions by a mixture of term rewriting and code compilation. Our formalization reveals several inconsistencies and contradictions in the current version of the OCL standard. Overall, this document is intended to provide the basis for a machine-checked text \"Annex A\" of the OCL standard targeting at tool implementors.",

Firstly, a generalization of several theorems of such library are presented. Secondly, some definitions and proofs involving Linear Algebra and the four fundamental subspaces of a matrix are shown. Finally, we present a proof of the result known in Linear Algebra as the “Rank-Nullity Theorem”, which states that, given any linear map f from a finite dimensional vector space V to a vector space W, then the dimension of V is equal to the dimension of the kernel of f (which is a subspace of V) and the dimension of the range of f (which is a subspace of W). The proof presented here is based on the one given by Sheldon Axler in his book \u003ci\u003eLinear Algebra Done Right\u003c/i\u003e. As a corollary of the previous theorem, and taking advantage of the relationship between linear maps and matrices, we prove that, for every matrix A (which has associated a linear map between finite dimensional vector spaces), the sum of its null space and its column space (which is equal to the range of the linear map) is equal to the number of columns of A.",

Radical expressions, which involve only square roots and arithmetic of rational numbers, are defined, and we find that all constructive points have radical coordinates. Finally, doubling the cube and trisecting certain angles requires solving certain cubic equations that can be proved to have no rational roots. The Isabelle proofs require a great many detailed calculations.",

  "abstract": "Distributed computing is inherently based on replication, promising increased tolerance to failures of individual computing nodes or communication channels. Realizing this promise, however, involves quite subtle algorithmic mechanisms, and requires precise statements about the kinds and numbers of faults that an algorithm tolerates (such as process crashes, communication faults or corrupted values).  The landmark theorem due to Fischer, Lynch, and Paterson shows that it is impossible to achieve Consensus among N asynchronously communicating nodes in the presence of even a single permanent failure. Existing solutions must rely on assumptions of \"partial synchrony\". \u003cp\u003e Indeed, there have been numerous misunderstandings on what exactly a given algorithm is supposed to realize in what kinds of environments. Moreover, the abundance of subtly different computational models complicates comparisons between different algorithms. Charron-Bost and Schiper introduced the Heard-Of model for representing algorithms and failure assumptions in a uniform framework, simplifying comparisons between algorithms. \u003cp\u003e In this contribution, we represent the Heard-Of model in Isabelle/HOL. We define two semantics of runs of algorithms with different unit of atomicity and relate these through a reduction theorem that allows us to verify algorithms in the coarse-grained semantics (where proofs are easier) and infer their correctness for the fine-grained one (which corresponds to actual executions). We instantiate the framework by verifying six Consensus algorithms that differ in the underlying algorithmic mechanisms and the kinds of faults they tolerate.",

  "abstract": "We formalise the pi-calculus using the nominal datatype package, based on ideas from the nominal logic by Pitts et al., and demonstrate an implementation in Isabelle/HOL. The purpose is to derive powerful induction rules for the semantics in order to conduct machine checkable proofs, closely following the intuitive arguments found in manual proofs. In this way we have covered many of the standard theorems of bisimulation equivalence and congruence, both late and early, and both strong and weak in a uniform manner. We thus provide one of the most extensive formalisations of a the pi-calculus ever done inside a theorem prover. \u003cp\u003e A significant gain in our formulation is that agents are identified up to alpha-equivalence, thereby greatly reducing the arguments about bound names. This is a normal strategy for manual proofs about the pi-calculus, but that kind of hand waving has previously been difficult to incorporate smoothly in an interactive theorem prover. We show how the nominal logic formalism and its support in Isabelle accomplishes this and thus significantly reduces the tedium of conducting completely formal proofs.

  "abstract": "Algebras of imperative programming languages have been successful in reasoning about programs. In general an algebra of programs is an algebraic structure with programs as elements and with program compositions (sequential composition, choice, skip) as algebra operations. Various versions of these algebras were introduced to model partial correctness, total correctness, refinement, demonic choice, and other aspects. We formalize here an algebra which can be used to model total correctness, refinement, demonic and angelic choice. The basic model of this algebra are monotonic Boolean transformers (monotonic functions from a Boolean algebra to itself).",

We present a program logic for a subset of sequential Java bytecode that is suitable for representing both, features found in high-level specification language JML as well as interpretations of high-level type systems. To this end, we introduce a fine-grained collection of assertions, including strong invariants, local annotations and VDM-reminiscent partial-correctness specifications. Thanks to a goal-oriented structure and interpretation of judgements, verification may proceed without recourse to an additional control flow analysis. The suitability for interpreting intensional type systems is illustrated by the proof-carrying-code style encoding of a type system for a first-order functional language which guarantees a constant upper bound on the number of objects allocated throughout an execution, be the execution terminating or non-terminating. Like the published paper, the formal development is restricted to a comparatively small subset of the JVML, lacking (among other features) exceptions, arrays, virtual methods, and static fields. This shortcoming has been overcome meanwhile, as our paper has formed the basis of the Mobius base logic, a program logic for the full sequential fragment of the JVML. Indeed, the present formalisation formed the basis of a subsequent formalisation of the Mobius base logic in the proof assistant Coq, which includes a proof of soundness with respect to the Bicolano operational semantics by Pichardie.",

  "abstract": "We present interpretations of type systems for secure information flow in Hoare logic, complementing previous encodings in relational program logics. We first treat the imperative language IMP, extended by a simple procedure call mechanism. For this language we consider base-line non-interference in the style of Volpano et al. and the flow-sensitive type system by Hunt and Sands. In both cases, we show how typing derivations may be used to automatically generate proofs in the program logic that certify the absence of illicit flows. We then add instructions for object creation and manipulation, and derive appropriate proof rules for base-line non-interference. As a consequence of our work, standard verification technology may be used for verifying that a concrete program satisfies the non-interference property.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe present proof development represents an update of the formalisation underlying our paper [CSF 2007] and is intended to resolve any ambiguities that may be present in the paper.",

  "abstract": "Slicing is a widely-used technique with applications in e.g. compiler technology and software security. Thus verification of algorithms in these areas is often based on the correctness of slicing, which should ideally be proven independent of concrete programming languages and with the help of well-known verifying techniques such as proof assistants. As a first step in this direction, this contribution presents a framework for dynamic and static intraprocedural slicing based on control flow and program dependence graphs. Abstracting from concrete syntax we base the framework on a graph representation of the program fulfilling certain structural and well-formedness properties.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe formalization consists of the basic framework (in subdirectory Basic/), the correctness proof for dynamic slicing (in subdirectory Dynamic/), the correctness proof for static intraprocedural slicing (in subdirectory StaticIntra/) and instantiations of the framework with a simple While language (in subdirectory While/) and the sophisticated object-oriented bytecode language of Jinja (in subdirectory JinjaVM/).

  "abstract": "The Volpano/Smith/Irvine security type systems requires that variables are annotated as high (secret) or low (public), and provides typing rules which guarantee that secret values cannot leak to public output ports. This property of a program is called confidentiality. For a simple while-language without threads, our proof shows that typeability in the Volpano/Smith system guarantees noninterference. Noninterference means that if two initial states for program execution are low-equivalent, then the final states are low-equivalent as well. This indeed implies that secret values cannot leak to public ports. The proof defines an abstract syntax and operational semantics for programs, formalizes noninterference, and then proceeds by rule induction on the operational semantics. The mathematically most intricate part is the treatment of implicit flows. Note that the Volpano/Smith system is not flow-sensitive and thus quite unprecise, resulting in false alarms. However, due to the correctness property, all potential breaks of confidentiality are discovered.",

  "abstract": "F. B. Schneider (\"Understanding protocols for Byzantine clock synchronization\") generalizes a number of protocols for Byzantine fault-tolerant clock synchronization and presents a uniform proof for their correctness. In Schneider's schema, each processor maintains a local clock by periodically adjusting each value to one computed by a convergence function applied to the readings of all the clocks. Then, correctness of an algorithm, i.e. that the readings of two clocks at any time are within a fixed bound of each other, is based upon some conditions on the convergence function. To prove that a particular clock synchronization algorithm is correct it suffices to show that the convergence function used by the algorithm meets Schneider's conditions. Using the theorem prover Isabelle, we formalize the proofs that the convergence functions of two algorithms, namely, the Interactive Convergence Algorithm (ICA) of Lamport and Melliar-Smith and the Fault-tolerant Midpoint algorithm of Lundelius-Lynch, meet Schneider's conditions. Furthermore, we experiment on handling some parts of the proofs with fully automatic tools like ICS and CVC-lite. These theories are part of a joint work with Alwen Tiu and Leonor P. Nieto \u003ca href=\"http://users.rsise.anu.edu.au/~tiu/clocksync.pdf\"\u003e\"Verification of Clock Synchronization Algorithms: Experiments on a combination of deductive tools\"\u003c/a\u003e in proceedings of AVOCS 2005.
