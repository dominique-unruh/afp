<p> A <em>residuated transition system</em> (RTS) is
a transition system that is equipped with a certain partial binary
operation, called <em>residuation</em>, on transitions.
Using the residuation operation, one can express nuances, such as a
distinction between nondeterministic and concurrent choice, as well as
partial commutativity relationships between transitions, which are not
captured by ordinary transition systems. A version of residuated
transition systems was introduced in previous work by the author, in
which they were called “concurrent transition systems” in view of the
original motivation for their definition from the study of
concurrency. In the first part of the present article, we give a
formal development that generalizes and subsumes the original
presentation. We give an axiomatic definition of residuated transition
systems that assumes only a single partial binary operation as given
structure. From the axioms, we derive notions of “arrow“ (transition),
“source”, “target”, “identity”, as well as “composition” and “join” of
transitions; thereby recovering structure that in the previous work
was assumed as given. We formalize and generalize the result, that
residuation extends from transitions to transition paths, and we
systematically develop the properties of this extension. A significant
generalization made in the present work is the identification of a
general notion of congruence on RTS’s, along with an associated
quotient construction. </p> <p> In the second part of this
article, we use the RTS framework to formalize several results in the
theory of reduction in Church’s λ-calculus. Using a de Bruijn
index-based syntax in which terms represent parallel reduction steps,
we define residuation on terms and show that it satisfies the axioms
for an RTS. An application of the results on paths from the first part
of the article allows us to prove the classical Church-Rosser Theorem
with little additional effort. We then use residuation to define the
notion of “development” and we prove the Finite Developments Theorem,
that every development is finite, formalizing and adapting to de
Bruijn indices a proof by de Vrijer. We also use residuation to define
the notion of a “standard reduction path”, and we prove the
Standardization Theorem: that every reduction path is congruent to a
standard one. As a corollary of the Standardization Theorem, we obtain
the Leftmost Reduction Theorem: that leftmost reduction is a
normalizing strategy. </p></td>
