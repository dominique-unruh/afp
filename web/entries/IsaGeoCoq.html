The GeoCoq library (Main autors: Michael Beeson, Pierre Boutry,
Gabriel Braun, Charly Gries, Julien Narboux) contains a formalization
of geometry using the Coq proof assistant. It contains both proofs
about the foundations of geometry and high-level proofs in the same
style as in high-school.  Some theorems also inspired by W.
Schwabha√ºser, W. Szmielew and A. Tarski are also formalized with
others ITP (Metamath, Mizar) or ATP.  We port a part of the GeoCoq
2.4.0 library within the Isabelle/Hol proof assistant: more precisely,
the files Chap02.v to Chap13_3.v, suma.v as well as the associated
definitions and some useful files for the demonstration of certain
parallel postulates.  While the demonstrations in Coq are written in
procedural language, the transcript is done in declarative language
Isar.  The synthetic approach of the demonstrations are directly
inspired by those contained in GeoCoq. Some demonstrations are
credited to G.E Martin(<<lemma bet_le__lt:>> in
Ch11_angles.thy, proved by Martin as Theorem 18.17) or Gupta H.N
(Krippen Lemma, proved by Gupta in its PhD in 1965 as Theorem 3.45).
In this work, the proofs are not contructive. The sledeghammer tool
being used to find some demonstrations.  The names of the lemmas and
theorems used are kept as far as possible as well as the definitions.
A different translation has been proposed when the name was already
used in Isabel/Hol ("Len" is translated as
"TarskiLen") or that characters were not allowed in
Isabel/Hol ("anga'" in Ch13_angles.v is translated as
"angaP"). For some definitions the highlighting of a
variable has changed the order or the position of the variables
(Midpoint, Out, Inter,...).  All the lemmas are valid in
absolute/neutral space defined with Tarski's axioms.  It should
be noted that T.J.M. Makarios \cite{afp-Tarskis_Geometry} has begun
some demonstrations of certain proposals mainly those corresponding to
SST chapters 2 and 3. It uses a definition that does not quite
coincide with the definition used in Geocoq and here. As an example,
Makarios introduces the axiom A11 (Axiom of continuity) in the
definition of the locale "Tarski_absolute_space".
Furthermore, the definition of the locale "TarskiAbsolute"
\cite{afp-Poincare_Disc} is not not identical to the one defined in
the "Tarski_neutral_dimensionless" class of GeoCoq. Indeed
this one does not contain the axiom "upper_dimension". In
some cases particular, it is nevertheless to use the axiom
"upper_dimension". The addition of the word "_2D"
in the file indicates its presence.  In the last part, it is
formalized that, in the neutral/absolute space, the axiom of the
parallels of the system of Tarski implies the Playfair axiom, the 5th
postulate of euclide and the postulate original from Euclid. These
proofs, which are not constructive, are directly inspired by Pierre
Boutry, Charly Gries, Julien Narboux and Pascal Schreck.</td>
