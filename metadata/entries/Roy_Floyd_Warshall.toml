abstract = """
This formulation of the Roy-Floyd-Warshall algorithm for the
transitive closure bypasses matrices and arrays, but uses a more direct
mathematical model with adjacency functions for immediate predecessors and
successors. This can be implemented efficiently in functional programming
languages and is particularly adequate for sparse relations."""
