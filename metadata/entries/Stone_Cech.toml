Building on parts of HOL-Analysis, we provide mathematical components for work on the 
  Stone-Cech compactification. The main concepts covered are: $C^*$-embedding, weak topologies 
  and compactification, focusing in particular on the Stone-Cech compactification of an 
  arbitrary Tychonov space $X$.

  Using traditional topological proof strategies we define the evaluation and 
  projection functions for product spaces, and show that product spaces carry the weak 
  topology induced by their projections whenever those projections separate points both 
  from each other and from closed sets.

  In particular, we show that the evaluation map from an arbitrary Tychonov space $X$ into 
  $\\beta{X}$ is a dense $C^*$-embedding, and then verify the Stone-Cech Extension Property: any 
  continuous map from $X$ to a compact Hausdorff space $K$ extends uniquely to a continuous map 
  from $\\beta{X}$ to $K$.

  Many of the proofs given here derive from those of Willard (<i>General Topology</i>, 1970, 
  Addison-Wesley) and Walker (<i>The Stone-Cech Compactification</i>, 1974, Springer-Verlag)."""
