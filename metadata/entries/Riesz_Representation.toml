We formalize the Riesz-Markov-Kakutani representation theorem following pp.37-47 of the book <i>Real and Complex Analysis</i> by Rudin.
This entry also includes formalization of regular measures, tightness of measures, and Urysohn's lemma on locally compact Hausdorff spaces.
Roughly speaking, the theorem states that
if $\\varphi$ is a positive linear functional from $C(X)$ (the space of continuous functions from $X$ to complex numbers which have compact supports) to complex numbers,
then there exists a unique measure $\\mu$ such that for all $f\\in C(X)$, \\[\\varphi(f) = \\int f \\mathrm{d}\\mu.\\]"""
