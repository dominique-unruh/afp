abstract = """
This theory provides a formalisation of linear temporal logic (LTL)
and unifies previous formalisations within the AFP. This entry
establishes syntax and semantics for this logic and decouples it from
existing entries, yielding a common environment for theories reasoning
about LTL. Furthermore a parser written in SML and an executable
simplifier are provided."""
