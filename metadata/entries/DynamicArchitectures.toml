abstract = """
The architecture of a system describes the system's overall
organization into components and connections between those components.
With the emergence of mobile computing, dynamic architectures have
become increasingly important. In such architectures, components may
appear or disappear, and connections may change over time. In the
following we mechanize a theory of dynamic architectures and verify
the soundness of a corresponding calculus. Therefore, we first
formalize the notion of configuration traces as a model for dynamic
architectures. Then, the behavior of single components is formalized
in terms of behavior traces and an operator is introduced and studied
to extract the behavior of a single component out of a given
configuration trace. Then, behavior trace assertions are introduced as
a temporal specification technique to specify behavior of components.
Reasoning about component behavior in a dynamic context is formalized
in terms of a calculus for dynamic architectures. Finally, the
soundness of the calculus is verified by introducing an alternative
interpretation for behavior trace assertions over configuration traces
and proving the rules of the calculus. Since projection may lead to
finite as well as infinite behavior traces, they are formalized in
terms of coinductive lists. Thus, our theory is based on
Lochbihler's formalization of coinductive lists. The theory may
be applied to verify properties for dynamic architectures."""
