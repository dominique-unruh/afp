abstract = """
A monitor is a runtime verification tool that solves the following
problem: Given a stream of time-stamped events and a policy formulated
in a specification language, decide whether the policy is satisfied at
every point in the stream. We verify the correctness of an executable
monitor for specifications given as formulas in metric first-order
dynamic logic (MFODL), which combines the features of metric
first-order temporal logic (MFOTL) and metric dynamic logic. Thus,
MFODL supports real-time constraints, first-order parameters, and
regular expressions. Additionally, the monitor supports aggregation
operations such as count and sum. This formalization, which is
described in a <a href=\"http://people.inf.ethz.ch/trayteld/papers/ijcar20-verimonplus/verimonplus.pdf\">
forthcoming paper at IJCAR 2020</a>, significantly extends <a
href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/MFOTL_Monitor.html\">previous
work on a verified monitor</a> for MFOTL. Apart from the
addition of regular expressions and aggregations, we implemented <a
href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Generic_Join.html\">multi-way
joins</a> and a specialized sliding window algorithm to further
optimize the monitor."""
