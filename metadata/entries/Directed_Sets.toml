<p>Directed sets are of fundamental interest in domain theory and topology. In
this paper, we formalize some results on directed sets in Isabelle/HOL, most
notably: under the axiom of choice, a poset has a supremum for every directed
set if and only if it does so for every chain; and a function between such
posets preserves suprema of directed sets if and only if it preserves suprema of
chains. The known pen-and-paper proofs of these results crucially use
uncountable transfinite sequences, which are not directly implementable in
Isabelle/HOL. We show how to emulate such proofs by utilizing Isabelle/HOL's
ordinal and cardinal library. Thanks to the formalization, we relax some
conditions for the above results.</p>"""
