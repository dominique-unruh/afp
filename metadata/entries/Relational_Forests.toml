We study second-order formalisations of graph properties expressed as
first-order formulas in relation algebras extended with a Kleene star.
The formulas quantify over relations while still avoiding
quantification over elements of the base set. We formalise the
property of undirected graphs being acyclic this way. This involves a
study of various kinds of orientation of graphs. We also verify basic
algorithms to constructively prove several second-order properties."""
