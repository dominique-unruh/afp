This entry provides executable formalisations of complete test
generation algorithms for finite state machines. It covers testing for
the language-equivalence and reduction conformance relations,
supporting the former via the W, Wp, HSI, H, SPY and SPYH-methods, and
the latter via adaptive state counting. The test strategies are
implemented using generic frameworks, allowing for reuse of shared
components between related strategies. This work is described in the
author&#x27;s <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.26092/elib/1665\">doctoral
thesis</a>."""
