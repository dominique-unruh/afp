abstract = """
The theory provides a formalisation of the Cocke-Younger-Kasami
algorithm (CYK for short), an approach to solving the word problem
for context-free languages.  CYK decides if a word is in the
languages generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form.
The formalized algorithm is executable."""
