abstract = """
We formalize HyperCTL*, a temporal logic for expressing security properties. We
first define a shallow embedding of HyperCTL*, within which we prove inductive and coinductive
rules for the operators. Then we show that a HyperCTL* formula captures Goguen-Meseguer
noninterference, a landmark information flow property. We also define a deep embedding and
connect it to the shallow embedding by a denotational semantics, for which we prove sanity w.r.t.
dependence on the free variables. Finally, we show that under some finiteness assumptions about
the model, noninterference is given by a (finitary) syntactic formula."""
