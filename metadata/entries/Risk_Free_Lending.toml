We construct an abstract ledger supporting the <em>risk-free
lending</em> protocol. The risk-free lending protocol is a system for
issuing and exchanging novel financial products we call <em>risk-free
loans</em>. The system allows one party to lend money at 0&percnt; APY
to another party in exchange for a good or service. On every update of
the ledger, accounts have interest distributed to them. Holders of
lent assets keep interest accrued by those assets. After distributing
interest, the system returns a fixed fraction of each loan. These
fixed fractions determine <em>loan periods</em>. Loans for longer
periods have a smaller fixed fraction returned. Loans may be re-lent
or used as collateral for other loans. We give a sufficient criterion
to enforce that all accounts will forever be solvent. We give a
protocol for maintaining this invariant when transferring or lending
funds. We also show that this invariant holds after an update. Even
though the system does not track counter-party obligations, we show
that all credited and debited loans cancel, and the monetary supply
grows at a specified interest rate."""
