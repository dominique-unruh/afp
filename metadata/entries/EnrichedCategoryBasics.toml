abstract = """
The notion of an enriched category generalizes the concept of category by replacing the hom-sets
of an ordinary category by objects of an arbitrary monoidal category.
In this article we give a formal definition of enriched categories and we give formal proofs
of a relatively narrow selection of facts about them.
One of the main results is a proof that a closed monoidal category can be regarded as a
category \"enriched in itself\".
The other main result is a proof of a version of the Yoneda Lemma for enriched categories."""
