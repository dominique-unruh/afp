abstract = "We provide a formalization of the mergesort algorithm as used in GHC's Data.List module, proving correctness and stability. Furthermore, experimental data suggests that generated (Haskell-)code for this algorithm is much faster than for previous algorithms available in the Isabelle distribution."
