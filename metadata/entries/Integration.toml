abstract = "Lebesgue-style integration plays a major role in advanced probability. We formalize concepts of elementary measure theory, real-valued random variables as Borel-measurable functions, and a stepwise inductive definition of the integral itself. All proofs are carried out in human readable style using the Isar language."
