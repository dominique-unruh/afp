<p>Runtime monitoring (or runtime verification) is an approach to
checking compliance of a system's execution with a specification
(e.g., a temporal formula). The system's execution is logged into a
<i>trace</i>&mdash;a sequence of time-points, each consisting of a
time-stamp and observed events. A <i>monitor</i> is an algorithm that
produces <i>verdicts</i> on the satisfaction of a temporal formula on
a trace.</p>
<p>We formalize the time-stamps as an abstract algebraic structure
satisfying certain assumptions. Instances of this structure include
natural numbers, real numbers, and lexicographic combinations of
them. We also include the formalization of a conversion from the
abstract time domain introduced by Koymans (1990) to our
time-stamps.</p>
<p>We formalize a monitoring algorithm for metric dynamic logic, an
extension of metric temporal logic with regular expressions. The
monitor computes whether a given formula is satisfied at every
position in an input trace of time-stamped events. Our monitor
follows the multi-head paradigm: it reads the input simultaneously at
multiple positions and moves its reading heads asynchronously. This
mode of operation results in unprecedented time and space complexity
guarantees for metric dynamic logic: The monitor's amortized time
complexity to process a time-point and the monitor's space complexity
neither depends on the event-rate, i.e., the number of events within
a fixed time-unit, nor on the numeric constants occurring in the
quantitative temporal constraints in the given formula.</p>
<p>The multi-head monitoring algorithm for metric dynamic logic is
reported in our paper “Multi-Head Monitoring of Metric Dynamic
Logic” published at ATVA 2020. We have also formalized unpublished
specialized algorithms for the temporal operators of metric temporal
logic.</p>"""
