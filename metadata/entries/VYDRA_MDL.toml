Runtime monitoring (or runtime verification) is an approach to
checking compliance of a system's execution with a specification
(e.g., a temporal query). The system's execution is logged into a
trace---a sequence of time-points, each consisting of a time-stamp and
observed events. A monitor is an algorithm that produces verdicts on
the satisfaction of a temporal query on a trace.  We formalize a
monitoring algorithm for metric dynamic logic, an extension of metric
temporal logic with regular expressions. The monitor computes whether
a given query is satisfied at every position in an input trace of
time-stamped events. We formalize the time-stamps as an abstract
algebraic structure satisfying certain assumptions. Instances of this
structure include natural numbers, real numbers, and lexicographic
combinations of them. Our monitor follows the multi-head paradigm: it
reads the input simultaneously at multiple positions and moves its
reading heads asynchronously. This mode of operation results in
unprecedented time and space complexity guarantees for metric dynamic
logic: The monitor's amortized time complexity to process a
time-point and the monitor's space complexity neither depends on
the event-rate, i.e., the number of events within a fixed time-unit,
nor on the numeric constants occurring in the quantitative temporal
constraints in the given query.  The multi-head monitoring algorithm
for metric dynamic logic is reported in our paper \"Multi-Head
Monitoring of Metric Dynamic Logic\" published at ATVA 2020. We
have also formalized unpublished specialized algorithms for the
temporal operators of metric temporal logic."""
