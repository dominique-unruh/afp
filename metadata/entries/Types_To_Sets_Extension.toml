In their article titled <i>From Types to Sets by Local Type
Definitions in Higher-Order Logic</i> and published in the
proceedings of the conference <i>Interactive Theorem
Proving</i> in 2016, Ondřej Kunčar and Andrei Popescu propose an
extension of the logic Isabelle/HOL and an associated algorithm for
the relativization of the <i>type-based theorems</i> to
more flexible <i>set-based theorems</i>, collectively
referred to as <i>Types-To-Sets</i>. One of the aims of
their work was to open an opportunity for the development of a
software tool for applied relativization in the implementation of the
logic Isabelle/HOL of the proof assistant Isabelle. In this article,
we provide a prototype of a software framework for the interactive
automated relativization of theorems in Isabelle/HOL, developed as an
extension of the proof language Isabelle/Isar. The software framework
incorporates the implementation of the proposed extension of the
logic, and builds upon some of the ideas for further work expressed in
the original article on Types-To-Sets by Ondřej Kunčar and Andrei
Popescu and the subsequent article <i>Smooth Manifolds and Types
to Sets for Linear Algebra in Isabelle/HOL</i> that was written
by Fabian Immler and Bohua Zhan and published in the proceedings of
the <i>International Conference on Certified Programs and
Proofs</i> in 2019."""
