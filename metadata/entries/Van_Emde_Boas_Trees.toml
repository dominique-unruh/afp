abstract = """
The <em>van Emde Boas tree</em> or <em>van Emde Boas
priority queue</em> is a data structure supporting membership
test, insertion, predecessor and successor search, minimum and maximum
determination and deletion in <em>O(log log U)</em> time, where <em>U =
0,...,2<sup>n-1</sup></em> is the overall range to be
considered. <p/> The presented formalization follows Chapter 20
of the popular <em>Introduction to Algorithms (3rd
ed.)</em> by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein (CLRS),
extending the list of formally verified CLRS algorithms. Our current
formalization is based on the first author's bachelor's
thesis. <p/> First, we prove correct a
<em>functional</em> implementation, w.r.t. an abstract
data type for sets. Apart from functional correctness, we show a
resource bound, and runtime bounds w.r.t. manually defined timing
functions for the operations. <p/> Next, we refine the
operations to Imperative HOL with time, and show correctness and
complexity. This yields a practically more efficient implementation,
and eliminates the manually defined timing functions from the trusted
base of the proof."""
