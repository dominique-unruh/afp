When verifying a concurrent program, it is usual to assume that memory
is sequentially consistent.  However, most modern multiprocessors
depend on store buffering for efficiency, and provide native
sequential consistency only at a substantial performance penalty.  To
regain sequential consistency, a programmer has to follow an
appropriate programming discipline. However, na&iuml;ve disciplines,
such as protecting all shared accesses with locks, are not flexible
enough for building high-performance multiprocessor software.  We
present a new discipline for concurrent programming under TSO (total
store order, with store buffer forwarding). It does not depend on
concurrency primitives, such as locks. Instead, threads use ghost
operations to acquire and release ownership of memory addresses. A
thread can write to an address only if no other thread owns it, and
can read from an address only if it owns it or it is shared and the
thread has flushed its store buffer since it last wrote to an address
it did not own. This discipline covers both coarse-grained concurrency
(where data is protected by locks) as well as fine-grained concurrency
(where atomic operations race to memory).  We formalize this
discipline in Isabelle/HOL, and prove that if every execution of a
program in a system without store buffers follows the discipline, then
every execution of the program with store buffers is sequentially
consistent. Thus, we can show sequential consistency under TSO by
ordinary assertional reasoning about the program, without having to
consider store buffers at all."""
