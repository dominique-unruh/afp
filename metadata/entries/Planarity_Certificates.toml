abstract = """
This development provides a formalization of planarity based on
combinatorial maps and proves that Kuratowski's theorem implies
combinatorial planarity.
Moreover, it contains verified implementations of programs checking
certificates for planarity (i.e., a combinatorial map) or non-planarity
(i.e., a Kuratowski subgraph)."""
