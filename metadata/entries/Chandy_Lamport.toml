We provide a suitable distributed system model and implementation of the
Chandy--Lamport distributed snapshot algorithm [ACM Transactions on
Computer Systems, 3, 63-75, 1985]. Our main result is a formal
termination and correctness proof of the Chandy--Lamport algorithm and
its use in stable property detection."""
