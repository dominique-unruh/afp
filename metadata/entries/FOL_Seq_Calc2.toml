We formalize an automated theorem prover for first-order logic with
functions. The proof search procedure is based on sequent calculus and
we verify its soundness and completeness using the Abstract Soundness
and Abstract Completeness theories. Our analytic completeness proof
covers both open and closed formulas. Since our deterministic prover
considers only the subset of terms relevant to proving a given
sequent, we do so as well when building a countermodel from a failed
proof. We formally connect our prover with the proof system and
semantics of the existing SeCaV system. In particular, the
prover's output can be post-processed in Haskell to generate
human-readable SeCaV proofs which are also machine-verifiable proof
certificates."""
