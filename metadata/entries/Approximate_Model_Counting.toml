abstract = """
Approximate model counting is the task of approximating the number of solutions
to an input formula.  This entry formalizes $\\mathsf{ApproxMC}$, an algorithm
due to Chakraborty et al. with a
probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantee, i.e., $\\mathsf{ApproxMC}$
returns a multiplicative $(1+\\varepsilon)$-factor approximation of the model
count with probability at least $1 - \\delta$, where $\\varepsilon > 0$ and $0 <
\\delta \\leq 1$.  The algorithmic specification is further refined to a verified
certificate checker that can be used to validate the results of untrusted
$\\mathsf{ApproxMC}$ implementations (assuming access to trusted randomness)."""
