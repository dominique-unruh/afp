abstract = """
This work is an effort to formalise some quantum algorithms and
results in quantum information theory. Formal methods being critical
for the safety and security of algorithms and protocols, we foresee
their widespread use for quantum computing in the future. We have
developed a large library for quantum computing in Isabelle based on a
matrix representation for quantum circuits, successfully formalising
the no-cloning theorem, quantum teleportation, Deutsch's
algorithm, the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and the quantum Prisoner's
Dilemma."""
