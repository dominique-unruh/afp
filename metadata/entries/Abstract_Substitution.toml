This entry provides a small, reusable, theory that specifies the abstract concept of substition as monoid action.
Both the substitution type and the object type are kept abstract.
The theory provides multiple useful definitions and lemmas.
Two example usages are provided for first order terms: one for terms from the AFP/First_Order_Terms session and one for terms from the Isabelle/HOL-ex session."""
