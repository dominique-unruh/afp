abstract = "In his seminal paper \"Natural Semantics for Lazy Evaluation\", John Launchbury proves his semantics correct with respect to a denotational semantics, and outlines an adequacy proof. We have formalized both semantics and machine-checked the correctness proof, clarifying some details. Furthermore, we provide a new and more direct adequacy proof that does not require intermediate operational semantics."
