\"Foundations of Geometry\" is a mathematical book written by
Hilbert in 1899. This entry is a complete formalization of
\"Incidence\" (excluding cubic axioms), \"Order\" and
\"Congruence\" (excluding point sequences) of the axioms
constructed in this book. In addition, the theorem of the problem
about the part that is treated implicitly and is not clearly stated in
