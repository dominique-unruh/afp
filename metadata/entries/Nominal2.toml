abstract = """
<p>Dealing with binders, renaming of bound variables, capture-avoiding
substitution, etc., is very often a major problem in formal
proofs, especially in proofs by structural and rule
induction. Nominal Isabelle is designed to make such proofs easy to
formalise: it provides an infrastructure for declaring nominal
datatypes (that is alpha-equivalence classes) and for defining
functions over them by structural recursion. It also provides
induction principles that have Barendregtâ€™s variable convention
already built in.
</p><p>
This entry can be used as a more advanced replacement for
HOL/Nominal in the Isabelle distribution.
