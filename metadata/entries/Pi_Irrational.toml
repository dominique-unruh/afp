<p>This entry provides a formalisation of Niven's famously
short one-page proof that $\\pi$ is irrational. The proof uses
only elementary algebra and analysis.</p>

<p>The intrinsic de Bruijn factor, i.e. the file size ratio between
the gzipped Isabelle sources and a gzipped LaTeX version of the original
paper's content, is roughly 4 despite the original paper's terse
presentation.</p>"""
