abstract = """
Based on Isabelle/HOL's type class for preorders,
we introduce a type class for well-quasi-orders (wqo)
which is characterized by the absence of \"bad\" sequences
(our proofs are along the lines of the proof of Nash-Williams,
from which we also borrow terminology). Our main results are
instantiations for the product type, the list type, and a type of finite trees,
which (almost) directly follow from our proofs of (1) Dickson's Lemma, (2)
Higman's Lemma, and (3) Kruskal's Tree Theorem. More concretely:
<ul>
<li>If the sets A and B are wqo then their Cartesian product is wqo.</li>
<li>If the set A is wqo then the set of finite lists over A is wqo.</li>
<li>If the set A is wqo then the set of finite trees over A is wqo.</li>
</ul>
