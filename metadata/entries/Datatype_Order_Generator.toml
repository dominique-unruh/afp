abstract = """
We provide a framework for registering automatic methods to derive
class instances of datatypes, as it is possible using Haskell's ``deriving Ord, Show, ...'' feature.
<p>
We further implemented such automatic methods to derive (linear) orders or hash-functions which are
required in the Isabelle Collection Framework. Moreover, for the tactic of Huffman and Krauss to show that a
datatype is countable, we implemented a wrapper so that this tactic becomes accessible in our framework.
<p>
Our formalization was performed as part of the <a href=\"http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/software/ceta\">IsaFoR/CeTA</a> project.
With our new tactic we could completely remove
tedious proofs for linear orders of two datatypes.
<p>
This development is aimed at datatypes generated by the \"old_datatype\"
command."""
