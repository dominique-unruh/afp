This theory is a formalization of the resolution calculus for
first-order logic. It is proven sound and complete. The soundness
proof uses the substitution lemma, which shows a correspondence
between substitutions and updates to an environment. The completeness
proof uses semantic trees, i.e. trees whose paths are partial Herbrand
interpretations. It employs Herbrand's theorem in a formulation which
states that an unsatisfiable set of clauses has a finite closed
semantic tree. It also uses the lifting lemma which lifts resolution
derivation steps from the ground world up to the first-order world.
The theory is presented in a paper in the Journal of Automated Reasoning
[Sch18] which extends a paper presented at the International Conference
on Interactive Theorem Proving [Sch16]. An earlier version was
presented in an MSc thesis [Sch15]. The formalization mostly follows
textbooks by Ben-Ari [BA12], Chang and Lee [CL73], and Leitsch [Lei97].
The theory is part of the IsaFoL project [IsaFoL]. <p>
