abstract = """
In the context of formal cryptographic protocol verification,
logging-independent message anonymity is the property for a given
message to remain anonymous despite the attacker's capability of
mapping messages of that sort to agents based on some intrinsic
feature of such messages, rather than by logging the messages
exchanged by legitimate agents as with logging-dependent message
anonymity.
This paper illustrates how logging-independent message
anonymity can be formalized according to the relational method for
formal protocol verification by considering a real-world protocol,
namely the Restricted Identification one by the BSI. This sample model
is used to verify that the pseudonymous identifiers output by user
identification tokens remain anonymous under the expected conditions."""
