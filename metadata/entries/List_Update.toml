<p>
These theories formalize the quantitative analysis of a number of classical algorithms for the list update problem: 2-competitiveness of move-to-front, the lower bound of 2 for the competitiveness of deterministic list update algorithms and 1.6-competitiveness of the randomized COMB algorithm, the best randomized list update algorithm known to date.
The material is based on the first two chapters of <i>Online Computation
and Competitive Analysis</i> by Borodin and El-Yaniv.
