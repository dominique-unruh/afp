Building on a previous <a
href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Bounded_Deducibility_Security.html\">AFP
entry</a> that formalizes the Bounded-Deducibility Security (BD
Security) framework <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ITP.2021.3\">[1]</a>,
we formalize compositionality and transport theorems for information
flow security. These results allow lifting BD Security properties from
individual components specified as transition systems, to a
composition of systems specified as communicating products of
transition systems. The underlying ideas of these results are
presented in the papers <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ITP.2021.3\">[1]</a>
and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1109/SP.2017.24\">[2]</a>.
The latter paper also describes a major case study where these results
have been used: on verifying the CoSMeDis distributed social media
platform (itself formalized as an <a
href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/CoSMeDis.html\">AFP
entry</a> that builds on this entry)."""
