<p>The Law of Large Numbers states that, informally, if one
performs a random experiment $X$ many times and takes the average of
the results, that average will be very close to the expected value
$E[X]$.</p> <p> More formally, let
$(X_i)_{i\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of independently identically
distributed random variables whose expected value $E[X_1]$ exists.
Denote the running average of $X_1, \\ldots, X_n$ as $\\overline{X}_n$.
Then:</p> <ul> <li>The Weak Law of Large Numbers
states that $\\overline{X}_{n} \\longrightarrow E[X_1]$ in probability
for $n\\to\\infty$, i.e. $\\mathcal{P}(|\\overline{X}_{n} - E[X_1]| >
\\varepsilon) \\longrightarrow 0$ as $n\\to\\infty$ for any $\\varepsilon
> 0$.</li> <li>The Strong Law of Large Numbers states
that $\\overline{X}_{n} \\longrightarrow E[X_1]$ almost surely for
$n\\to\\infty$, i.e. $\\mathcal{P}(\\overline{X}_{n} \\longrightarrow
E[X_1]) = 1$.</li> </ul> <p>In this entry, I
formally prove the strong law and from it the weak law. The approach
used for the proof of the strong law is a particularly quick and slick
one based on ergodic theory, which was formalised by GouÃ«zel in
another AFP entry.</p>"""
