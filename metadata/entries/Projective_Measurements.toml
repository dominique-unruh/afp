This work contains a formalization of quantum projective measurements,
also known as von Neumann measurements, which are based on elements of
spectral theory. We also formalized the CHSH inequality, an inequality
involving expectations in a probability space that is violated by
quantum measurements, thus proving that quantum mechanics cannot be modeled with an underlying local hidden-variable theory."""
