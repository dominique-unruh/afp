abstract = """
We present a formalization of probabilistic timed automata (PTA) for
which we try to follow the formula MDP + TA = PTA as far as possible:
our work starts from our existing formalizations of Markov decision
processes (MDP) and timed automata (TA) and combines them modularly.
We prove the fundamental result for probabilistic timed automata: the
region construction that is known from timed automata carries over to
the probabilistic setting. In particular, this allows us to prove that
minimum and maximum reachability probabilities can be computed via a
reduction to MDP model checking, including the case where one wants to
disregard unrealizable behavior. Further information can be found in
our ITP paper [2]."""
