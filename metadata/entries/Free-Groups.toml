Free Groups are, in a sense, the most generic kind of group. They
are defined over a set of generators with no additional relations in between
them. They play an important role in the definition of group presentations
and in other fields. This theory provides the definition of Free Group as
the set of fully canceled words in the generators. The universal property is
proven, as well as some isomorphisms results about Free Groups."""
