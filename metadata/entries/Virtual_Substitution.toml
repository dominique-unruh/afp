This paper presents a formally verified quantifier elimination (QE)
algorithm for first-order real arithmetic by linear and quadratic
virtual substitution (VS) in Isabelle/HOL. The Tarski-Seidenberg
theorem established that the first-order logic of real arithmetic is
decidable by QE. However, in practice, QE algorithms are highly
complicated and often combine multiple methods for performance. VS is
a practically successful method for QE that targets formulas with
low-degree polynomials. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
formalize VS for quadratic real arithmetic including inequalities. The
proofs necessitate various contributions to the existing multivariate
polynomial libraries in Isabelle/HOL. Our framework is modularized and
easily expandable (to facilitate integrating future optimizations),
and could serve as a basis for developing practical general-purpose QE
algorithms. Further, as our formalization is designed with
practicality in mind, we export our development to SML and test the
resulting code on 378 benchmarks from the literature, comparing to
Redlog, Z3, Wolfram Engine, and SMT-RAT. This identified
inconsistencies in some tools, underscoring the significance of a
verified approach for the intricacies of real arithmetic."""
