abstract = """
We present an executable formally verified SAT encoding of classical
AI planning that is based on the encodings by Kautz and Selman and the
one by Rintanen et al. The encoding was experimentally tested and
shown to be usable for reasonably sized standard AI planning
benchmarks. We also use it as a reference to test a state-of-the-art
SAT-based planner, showing that it sometimes falsely claims that
problems have no solutions of certain lengths. The formalisation in
this submission was described in an independent publication."""
