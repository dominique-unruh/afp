We present an Isabelle formalization of the basics of Dynamic Condition Response
(DCR) graphs before defining Execution Equivalent markings. We then prove that
execution equivalent markings are perfectly interchangeable during process
execution, yielding significant state-space reduction for execution-based
model-checking of DCR graphs."""
