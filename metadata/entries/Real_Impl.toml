abstract = """
We apply data refinement to implement the real numbers, where we support all
numbers in the field extension Q[sqrt(b)], i.e., all numbers of the form p +
q * sqrt(b) for rational numbers p and q and some fixed natural number b. To
this end, we also developed algorithms to precisely compute roots of a
rational number, and to perform a factorization of natural numbers which
eliminates duplicate prime factors.
<p>
Our results have been used to certify termination proofs which involve
polynomial interpretations over the reals."""
