Rensets are an algebraic axiomatization of renaming (variable-for-variable substitution). 
The formalization includes a connection with nominal sets, showing that any renset naturally gives rise to a nominal set. It also includes examples of deploying the renaming-based recursor:  semantic interpretation, counting functions for free and bound occurrences, unary and parallel substitution, etc. Finally, it includes a variation of rensets that axiomatize term-for-variable substitution, called <i>substitutive sets</i>, which yields a  corresponding recursion principle."""
