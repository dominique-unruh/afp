The UpDown scheme is a recursive scheme used to compute the stiffness matrix
on a special form of sparse grids. Usually, when discretizing a Euclidean
space of dimension d we need O(n^d) points, for n points along each dimension.
Sparse grids are a hierarchical representation where the number of points is
reduced to O(n * log(n)^d). One disadvantage of such sparse grids is that the
algorithm now operate recursively in the dimensions and levels of the sparse grid.
<p>
The UpDown scheme allows us to compute the stiffness matrix on such a sparse
grid. The stiffness matrix represents the influence of each representation
function on the L^2 scalar product. For a detailed description see
Dirk Pflüger's PhD thesis. This formalization was developed as an
interdisciplinary project (IDP) at the Technische Universität München."""
