abstract = """
These theories present the verified enumeration of <i>tame</i> plane graphs
as defined by Thomas C. Hales in his proof of the Kepler Conjecture in his
book <i>Dense Sphere Packings. A Blueprint for Formal Proofs.</i> [CUP 2012].
The values of the constants in the definition of tameness are identical to
those in the <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/flyspeck/\">Flyspeck project</a>.
The <a href=\"http://www21.in.tum.de/~nipkow/pubs/Flyspeck/\">IJCAR 2006 paper by Nipkow, Bauer and Schultz</a> refers to the original version of Hales' proof,
the <a href=\"http://www21.in.tum.de/~nipkow/pubs/itp11.html\">ITP 2011 paper by Nipkow</a> refers to the Blueprint version of the proof."""
