Sturm's Theorem states that polynomial sequences with certain
properties, so-called Sturm sequences, can be used to count the number
of real roots of a real polynomial. This work contains a proof of
Sturm's Theorem and code for constructing Sturm sequences efficiently.
It also provides the “sturm” proof method, which can decide certain
statements about the roots of real polynomials, such as “the polynomial
P has exactly n roots in the interval I” or “P(x) > Q(x) for all x
&#8712; &#8477;”."""
