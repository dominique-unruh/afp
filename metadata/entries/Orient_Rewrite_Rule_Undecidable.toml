abstract = """
We formalize several undecidability results on termination 
for <em>one-rule</em> term 
rewrite systems by means of simple reductions from Hilbert's 10th problem.
To be more precise, for a class \\(C\\) of reduction orders, 
we consider the question for a given rewrite 
rule \\(\\ell \\to r\\), whether there is some
reduction order \\({\\succ} \\in C\\) such that \\(\\ell \\succ r\\). We include undecidability results for each of the following classes \\(C\\):
<ul>
<li> the class of <em>linear</em> polynomial interpretations over
  the natural numbers,</li>
<li> the class of linear polynomial interpretations over
  the natural numbers in the <em>weakly monotone</em> setting, </li>
<li> the class of Knuth&ndash;Bendix orders with <em>subterm coefficients</em>,</li>
<li> the class of <em>non-linear</em> polynomial interpretations over the natural numbers, and</li>
<li> the class of non-linear polynomial interpretations over the <em>rational</em> and <em>real</em> numbers.
</ul>"""
