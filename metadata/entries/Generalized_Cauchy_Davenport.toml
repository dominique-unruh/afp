The Cauchy--Davenport theorem is a fundamental result in additive combinatorics.
It was originally independently discovered by Cauchy and Davenport and has been formalized in the AFP entry <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Kneser_Cauchy_Davenport.html\">Kneser's Theorem and the Cauchy–Davenport Theorem</a> as a corollary of Kneser's theorem.
More recently, many generalizations of this theorem have been found. In this entry, we formalise a <a href=\"https://math.colgate.edu/~integers/q7/q7.Abstract.html\">generalization due to DeVos</a>, which proves the theorem in a non-abelian setting."""
