This entry provides a verified implementation of rank-based Büchi
Complementation. The verification is done in three steps: <ol>
<li>Definition of odd rankings and proof that an automaton
rejects a word iff there exists an odd ranking for it.</li>
<li>Definition of the complement automaton and proof that it
accepts exactly those words for which there is an odd
ranking.</li> <li>Verified implementation of the
complement automaton using the Isabelle Collections
Framework.</li> </ol>"""
