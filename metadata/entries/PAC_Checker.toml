abstract = """
Generating and checking proof certificates is important to increase
the trust in automated reasoning tools. In recent years formal
verification using computer algebra became more important and is
heavily used in automated circuit verification.  An existing proof
format which covers algebraic reasoning and allows efficient proof
checking is the practical algebraic calculus (PAC). In this
development, we present the verified checker Past√®que that is obtained
by synthesis via the Refinement Framework.  This is the formalization
going with our FMCAD'20 tool presentation."""
