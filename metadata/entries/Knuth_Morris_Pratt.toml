The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm is often used to show that the
problem of finding a string <i>s</i> in a text
<i>t</i> can be solved deterministically in
<i>O(|s| + |t|)</i> time. We use the Isabelle
Refinement Framework to formulate and verify the algorithm. Via
refinement, we apply some optimisations and finally use the
<em>Sepref</em> tool to obtain executable code in
<em>Imperative/HOL</em>."""
