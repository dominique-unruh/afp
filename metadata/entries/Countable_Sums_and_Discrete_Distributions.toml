abstract = "We provide elementary formalizations of countable sums over positive real numbers, and of discrete probabilistic subdistributions and distributions. This is intended as a lightweight alternative to the corresponding concepts from the Isabelle distribution, which are defined using their continuous counterparts (namely Lebesgue integral and general probability distributions) and therefore have significant dependencies."
