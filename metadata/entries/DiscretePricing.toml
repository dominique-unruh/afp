We have formalized the computation of fair prices for derivative
products in discrete financial models. As an application, we derive a
way to compute fair prices of derivative products in the
Cox-Ross-Rubinstein model of a financial market, thus completing the
work that was presented in this <a
href=\"https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01562944\">paper</a>."""

Renamed discr_mkt predicate to stk_strict_subs and got rid of predicate A for a more natural definition of the type discrete_market;
renamed basic quantity processes for coherent notation;
renamed value_process into val_process and closing_value_process to cls_val_process;
relaxed hypothesis of lemma CRR_market_fair_price.
Added functions to price some basic options.
