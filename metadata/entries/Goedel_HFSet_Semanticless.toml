We validate an abstract formulation of G&ouml;del's Second
Incompleteness Theorem from a <a
href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Goedel_Incompleteness.html\">separate
AFP entry</a> by instantiating it to the case of <i>finite
consistent extensions of the Hereditarily Finite (HF) Set
theory</i>, i.e., consistent FOL theories extending the HF Set
theory with a finite set of axioms.  The instantiation draws heavily
on infrastructure previously developed by Larry Paulson in his <a
href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Incompleteness.html\">direct
formalisation of the concrete result</a>. It strengthens
Paulson's formalization of G&ouml;del's Second from that
entry by <i>not</i> assuming soundness, and in fact not
relying on any notion of model or semantic interpretation. The
strengthening was obtained by first replacing some of Paulsonâ€™s
semantic arguments with proofs within his HF calculus, and then
plugging in some of Paulson's (modified) lemmas to instantiate
our soundness-free G&ouml;del's Second locale."""
