abstract = """
We implemented a type class for \"to-string\" functions, similar to
Haskell's Show class. Moreover, we provide instantiations for Isabelle/HOL's
standard types like bool, prod, sum, nats, ints, and rats. It is further
possible, to automatically derive show functions for arbitrary user defined
datatypes similar to Haskell's \"deriving Show\"."""
