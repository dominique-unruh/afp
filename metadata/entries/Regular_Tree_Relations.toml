abstract = """
Tree automata have good closure properties and therefore a commonly
used to prove/disprove properties. This formalization contains among
other things the proofs of many closure properties of tree automata
(anchored) ground tree transducers and regular relations. Additionally
it includes the well known pumping lemma and a lifting of the Myhill
Nerode theorem for regular languages to tree languages.  We want to
mention the existence of a <a
href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Tree-Automata.html\">tree
automata APF-entry</a> developed by Peter Lammich. His work is
based on epsilon free top-down tree automata, while this entry builds
on bottom-up tree auotamta with epsilon transitions. Moreover our
formalization relies on the <a
href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Collections.html\">Collections
Framework</a>, also by Peter Lammich, to obtain efficient code.
All proven constructions of the closure properties are exportable
using the Isabelle/HOL code generation facilities."""
