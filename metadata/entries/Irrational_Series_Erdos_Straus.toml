We formalise certain irrationality criteria for infinite series of the form:
\\[\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{b_n}{\\prod_{i=1}^n a_i} \\]
where $\\{b_n\\}$ is a sequence of integers and $\\{a_n\\}$ a sequence of positive integers
with $a_n >1$ for all large n. The results are due to P. Erdős and E. G. Straus
<a href=\"https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.pjm/1102911140\">[1]</a>.
In particular, we formalise Theorem 2.1, Corollary 2.10 and Theorem 3.1.
The latter is an application of Theorem 2.1 involving the prime numbers."""
