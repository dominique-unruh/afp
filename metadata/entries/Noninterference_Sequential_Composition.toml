abstract = """
<p>In his outstanding work on Communicating Sequential Processes, Hoare
has defined two fundamental binary operations allowing to compose the
input processes into another, typically more complex, process:
sequential composition and concurrent composition. Particularly, the
output of the former operation is a process that initially behaves
like the first operand, and then like the second operand once the
execution of the first one has terminated successfully, as long as it
does.</p>
<p>This paper formalizes Hoare's definition of sequential
composition and proves, in the general case of a possibly intransitive
policy, that CSP noninterference security is conserved under this
operation, provided that successful termination cannot be affected by
confidential events and cannot occur as an alternative to other events
in the traces of the first operand. Both of these assumptions are
shown, by means of counterexamples, to be necessary for the theorem to
hold.</p>"""
