abstract = """
In this article, we present a formalization of the well-known
\"Hello, World!\" code, including a formal framework for
reasoning about IO. Our model is inspired by the handling of IO in
Haskell. We start by formalizing the üåç and embrace the IO monad
afterwards. Then we present a sample main :: IO (), followed by its
proof of correctness."""
