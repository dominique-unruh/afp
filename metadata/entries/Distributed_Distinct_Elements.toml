abstract = "This entry formalizes a randomized cardinality estimation data structure with asymptotically optimal space usage. It is inspired by the streaming algorithm presented by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1145/3309193\">B&lstrok;asiok</a> in 2018. His work closed the gap between the best-known lower bound and upper bound after a long line of research started by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-0000(85)90041-8\">Flajolet and Martin</a> in 1984 and was to first to apply expander graphs (in addition to hash families) to the problem. The formalized algorithm has two improvements compared to the algorithm by B&lstrok;asiok. It supports operation in parallel mode, and it relies on a simpler pseudo-random construction avoiding the use of code based extractors."
