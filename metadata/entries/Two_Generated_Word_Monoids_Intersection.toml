abstract = """
This article provides a formalization of the classification of intersection
\\( \\{x,y\\}^* \\cap \\{u,v\\}^*\\) of two monoids generated by two element codes.
Namely, the intersection has one of the following forms
\\( \\{\\beta,\\gamma\\}^* \\quad \\text{ or } \\quad \\left(\\beta_0 + \\beta(\\gamma(1+\\delta+ \\cdots + \\delta^t))^*\\epsilon\\right)^*.\\)
Note that it can be infinitely generated.

The result is due to <a href=”https://doi.org/10.1007/BFb0036924”>[Karhumäki, 84]</a>. Our proof uses the terminology of morphisms which allows us to formulate the result in a shorter and more transparent way."""
