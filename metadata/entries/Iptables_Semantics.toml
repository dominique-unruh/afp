abstract = """
We present a big step semantics of the filtering behavior of the
Linux/netfilter iptables firewall. We provide algorithms to simplify
complex iptables rulests to a simple firewall model (c.f. AFP entry <a
href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Simple_Firewall.html\">Simple_Firewall</a>)
and to verify spoofing protection of a ruleset.
Internally, we embed our semantics into ternary logic, ultimately
supporting every iptables match condition by abstracting over
unknowns. Using this AFP entry and all entries it depends on, we
created an easy-to-use, stand-alone haskell tool called <a
href=\"http://iptables.isabelle.systems\">fffuu</a>. The tool does not
require any input &mdash;except for the <tt>iptables-save</tt> dump of
the analyzed firewall&mdash; and presents interesting results about
the user's ruleset. Real-Word firewall errors have been uncovered, and
the correctness of rulesets has been proved, with the help of
our tool."""
