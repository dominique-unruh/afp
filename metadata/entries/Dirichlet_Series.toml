This entry is a formalisation of much of Chapters 2, 3, and 11 of
Apostol's &ldquo;Introduction to Analytic Number
Theory&rdquo;. This includes: <ul> <li>Definitions and
basic properties for several number-theoretic functions (Euler's
&phi;, M&ouml;bius &mu;, Liouville's &lambda;,
the divisor function &sigma;, von Mangoldt's
&Lambda;)</li> <li>Executable code for most of these
functions, the most efficient implementations using the factoring
algorithm by Thiemann <i>et al.</i></li>
<li>Dirichlet products and formal Dirichlet series</li>
<li>Analytic results connecting convergent formal Dirichlet
series to complex functions</li> <li>Euler product
expansions</li> <li>Asymptotic estimates of
number-theoretic functions including the density of squarefree
integers and the average number of divisors of a natural
number</li> </ul> These results are useful as a basis for
developing more number-theoretic results, such as the Prime Number
Theorem."""
