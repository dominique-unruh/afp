<p>Minkowski's theorem relates a subset of
&#8477;<sup>n</sup>, the Lebesgue measure, and the
integer lattice &#8484;<sup>n</sup>: It states that
any convex subset of &#8477;<sup>n</sup> with volume
greater than 2<sup>n</sup> contains at least one lattice
point from &#8484;<sup>n</sup>\\{0}, i.&thinsp;e. a
non-zero point with integer coefficients.</p>  <p>A
related theorem which directly implies this is Blichfeldt's
theorem, which states that any subset of
&#8477;<sup>n</sup> with a volume greater than 1
contains two different points whose difference vector has integer
components.</p>  <p>The entry contains a proof of both
theorems.</p>"""
