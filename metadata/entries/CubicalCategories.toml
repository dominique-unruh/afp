This AFP entry formalises cubical omega-categories and cubical
  omega-categories with connections in the style of single-set
  categories. Cubical categories, and the cubical sets on which they
  are based, have their origins and main applications in algebraic
  topology. Applications in computer science include homotopy type
  theory, higher-dimensional automata in concurrency theory and
  higher-dimensional rewriting. The single-set axiomatisation,
  introduced in these components and a companion paper, allows a
  formalisation based on Isabelle's type classes."""
