abstract = """
We present a semantic embedding of a spatio-temporal multi-modal
logic, specifically defined to reason about motorway traffic, into
Isabelle/HOL. The semantic model is an abstraction of a motorway,
emphasising local spatial properties, and parameterised by the types
of sensors deployed in the vehicles. We use the logic to define
controller constraints to ensure safety, i.e., the absence of
collisions on the motorway. After proving safety with a restrictive
definition of sensors, we relax these assumptions and show how to
amend the controller constraints to still guarantee safety."""
