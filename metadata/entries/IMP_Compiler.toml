abstract = """
This paper presents a compiler correctness proof for the didactic
imperative programming language IMP, introduced in Nipkow and
Klein's book on formal programming language semantics (version of
March 2021), whose size is just two thirds of the book's proof in
the number of formal text lines. As such, it promises to constitute a
further enhanced reference for the formal verification of compilers
meant for larger, real-world programming languages.  The presented
proof does not depend on language determinism, so that the proposed
approach can be applied to non-deterministic languages as well. As a
confirmation, this paper extends IMP with an additional
non-deterministic choice command, and proves compiler correctness,
viz. the simulation of compiled code execution by source code, for
such extended language."""
