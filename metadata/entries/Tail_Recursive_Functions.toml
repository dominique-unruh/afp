<p>
Tail-recursive function definitions are sometimes more straightforward than
alternatives, but proving theorems on them may be roundabout because of the
peculiar form of the resulting recursion induction rules.
</p><p>
This paper describes a proof method that provides a general solution to
this problem by means of suitable invariants over inductive sets, and
illustrates the application of such method by examining two case studies.
