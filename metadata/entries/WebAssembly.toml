This is a mechanised specification of the WebAssembly language, drawn
mainly from the previously published paper formalisation of Haas et
al. Also included is a full proof of soundness of the type system,
together with a verified type checker and interpreter. We include only
a partial procedure for the extraction of the type checker and
interpreter here. For more details, please see our paper in CPP 2018."""
