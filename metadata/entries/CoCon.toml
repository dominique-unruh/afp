This entry contains the confidentiality verification of the
(functional kernel of) the CoCon conference management system [<a
href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-08867-9_11\">1</a>,
<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10817-020-09566-9\">2</a>].
The confidentiality properties refer to the documents managed by the
system, namely papers, reviews, discussion logs and
acceptance/rejection decisions, and also to the assignment of
reviewers to papers. They have all been formulated as instances of BD
Security [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ITP.2021.3\">3</a>,
<a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Bounded_Deducibility_Security.html\">4</a>]
