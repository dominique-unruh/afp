2016</a>] introduces an abstract approach to composable security
statements that allows one to focus on a particular aspect of security
proofs at a time. Instead of proving the properties of concrete
systems, CC studies system classes, i.e., the shared behavior of
similar systems, and their transformations.  Modeling of systems
communication plays a crucial role in composability and reusability of
security statements; yet, this aspect has not been studied in any of
the existing CC results. We extend our previous CC formalization

Templates (FRT) that abstracts over the systems communication patterns
in CC proofs. This widens the scope of cryptography proof
