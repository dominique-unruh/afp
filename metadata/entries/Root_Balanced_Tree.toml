<p>
Andersson introduced <em>general balanced trees</em>,
search trees based on the design principle of partial rebuilding:
perform update operations naively until the tree becomes too
unbalanced, at which point a whole subtree is rebalanced.  This article
defines and analyzes a functional version of general balanced trees,
which we call <em>root-balanced trees</em>. Using a lightweight model
of execution time, amortized logarithmic complexity is verified in
the theorem prover Isabelle.

<p>
This is the Isabelle formalization of the material decribed in the APLAS 2017 article
<a href=\"http://www21.in.tum.de/~nipkow/pubs/aplas17.html\">Verified Root-Balanced Trees</a>
by the same author, which also presents experimental results that show
competitiveness of root-balanced with AVL and red-black trees.
