abstract = """
We provide a characterisation of how information is propagated by
program executions based on the tracking data and control dependencies
within executions themselves.  The characterisation might be used for
deriving approximative safety properties to be targeted by static
analyses or checked at runtime.  We utilise a simple yet versatile
control flow graph model as a program representation.  As our model is
not assumed to be finite it can be instantiated for a broad class of
programs.  The targeted security property is indistinguishable
security where executions produce sequences of observations and only
non-terminating executions are allowed to drop a tail of those.  A
very crude approximation of our characterisation is slicing based on
program dependence graphs, which we use as a minimal example and
derive a corresponding soundness result.  For further details and
applications refer to the authors upcoming dissertation."""
