This entry formalizes the classification of the finite fields (also
called Galois fields): For each prime power $p^n$ there exists exactly
one (up to isomorphisms) finite field of that size and there are no
other finite fields. The derivation includes a formalization of the
characteristic of rings, the Frobenius endomorphism, formal differentiation
for polynomials in HOL-Algebra, Rabin's test for the irreducibility of
polynomials and Gauss' formula for the number of monic irreducible
polynomials over finite fields: \\[
\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d | n} \\mu(d) p^{n/d} \\textrm{.} \\] The proofs are
based on the books and publications from <a
href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4757-2103-4\">Ireland
and Rosen</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1137/0209024\">Rabin</a>, as
well as, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139172769\">Lidl and
Niederreiter</a>."""
