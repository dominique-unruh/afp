<p>This article provides a formalisation of Snyder’s simple and
elegant proof of the Mason&ndash;Stothers theorem, which is the
polynomial analogue of the famous abc Conjecture for integers.
Remarkably, Snyder found this very elegant proof when he was still a
high-school student.</p> <p>In short, the statement of the
theorem is that three non-zero coprime polynomials
<em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>
over a field which sum to 0 and do not all have vanishing derivatives
fulfil max{deg(<em>A</em>), deg(<em>B</em>),
deg(<em>C</em>)} < deg(rad(<em>ABC</em>))
where the rad(<em>P</em>) denotes the
<em>radical</em> of <em>P</em>,
i.&thinsp;e. the product of all unique irreducible factors of
<em>P</em>.</p> <p>This theorem also implies a
kind of polynomial analogue of Fermat’s Last Theorem for polynomials:
except for trivial cases,
<em>A<sup>n</sup></em> +
<em>B<sup>n</sup></em> +
<em>C<sup>n</sup></em> = 0 implies
n&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;2 for coprime polynomials
<em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>
over a field.</em></p>"""
