<p>This entry provides an executable functional implementation
of the Median-of-Medians algorithm for selecting the
<em>k</em>-th smallest element of an unsorted list
deterministically in linear time. The size bounds for the recursive
call that lead to the linear upper bound on the run-time of the
algorithm are also proven. </p>"""
