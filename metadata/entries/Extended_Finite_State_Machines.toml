abstract = """
In this AFP entry, we provide a formalisation of extended finite state
machines (EFSMs) where models are represented as finite sets of
transitions between states. EFSMs execute traces to produce observable
outputs. We also define various simulation and equality metrics for
EFSMs in terms of traces and prove their strengths in relation to each
other. Another key contribution is a framework of function definitions
such that LTL properties can be phrased over EFSMs. Finally, we
provide a simple example case study in the form of a drinks machine."""
