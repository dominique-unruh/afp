abstract = """
LTL3 is a multi-valued variant of Linear-time Temporal Logic for runtime verification
applications, originally due to Bauer et al. The semantic descriptions of LTL3 in
previous work are given only in terms of the relationship to conventional LTL. In this
submission, which accompanies our EXPRESS/SOS 2024 paper, \"Semantics for Linear-time Temporal Logic with Finite Observations\", we instead give a full model-based inductive accounting of the semantics of LTL3, in terms of families of <em>definitive prefix sets</em>. We show that our definitive prefix sets are isomorphic to linear-time temporal properties (sets of infinite traces), and thereby show that our semantics
of LTL3 directly correspond to the semantics of conventional LTL. In addition, we
formalise the formula progression evaluation technique originally due to Kabanza et al., popularly used in runtime
verification and testing contexts, and show its soundness and completeness up to finite traces with respect to our semantics."""
