<p> This entry formalizes some classical concepts and results
from inductive inference of recursive functions. In the basic setting
a partial recursive function (\"strategy\") must identify
(\"learn\") all functions from a set (\"class\") of
recursive functions. To that end the strategy receives more and more
values $f(0), f(1), f(2), \\ldots$ of some function $f$ from the given
class and in turn outputs descriptions of partial recursive functions,
for example, GÃ¶del numbers. The strategy is considered successful if
the sequence of outputs (\"hypotheses\") converges to a
description of $f$. A class of functions learnable in this sense is
called \"learnable in the limit\". The set of all these
classes is denoted by LIM. </p>  <p> Other types of
inference considered are finite learning (FIN), behaviorally correct
learning in the limit (BC), and some variants of LIM with restrictions
on the hypotheses: total learning (TOTAL), consistent learning (CONS),
and class-preserving learning (CP). The main results formalized are
the proper inclusions $\\mathrm{FIN} \\subset \\mathrm{CP} \\subset
\\mathrm{TOTAL} \\subset \\mathrm{CONS} \\subset \\mathrm{LIM} \\subset
\\mathrm{BC} \\subset 2^{\\mathcal{R}}$, where $\\mathcal{R}$ is the set
of all total recursive functions.  Further results show that for all
these inference types except CONS, strategies can be assumed to be
total recursive functions; that all inference types but CP are closed
under the subset relation between classes; and that no inference type
is closed under the union of classes. </p>  <p> The above
is based on a formalization of recursive functions heavily inspired by
the <a
href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Universal_Turing_Machine.html\">Universal
Turing Machine</a> entry by Xu et al., but different in that it
models partial functions with codomain <em>nat
option</em>. The formalization contains a construction of a
universal partial recursive function, without resorting to Turing
machines, introduces decidability and recursive enumerability, and
proves some standard results: existence of a Kleene normal form, the
<em>s-m-n</em> theorem, Rice's theorem, and assorted
fixed-point theorems (recursion theorems) by Kleene, Rogers, and
Smullyan. </p>"""
