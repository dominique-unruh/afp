abstract = """
The 1985 paper by Carlos Alchourrón, Peter Gärdenfors, and David
Makinson (AGM), “On the Logic of Theory Change: Partial Meet
Contraction and Revision Functions” launches a large and rapidly
growing literature that employs formal models and logics to handle
changing beliefs of a rational agent and to take into account new
piece of information observed by this agent. In 2011, a review book
titled \"AGM 25 Years: Twenty-Five Years of Research in Belief
Change\" was edited to summarize the first twenty five years of
works based on AGM.  This  HOL-based  AFP entry is a faithful
formalization of the AGM operators (e.g. contraction, revision,
remainder ...) axiomatized in the original paper. It also contains the
proofs of all the theorems stated in the paper that show how these
operators combine. Both proofs of Harper and Levi identities are
established."""
