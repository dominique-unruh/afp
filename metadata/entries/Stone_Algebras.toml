abstract = """
A range of algebras between lattices and Boolean algebras generalise
the notion of a complement. We develop a hierarchy of these
pseudo-complemented algebras that includes Stone algebras.
Independently of this theory we study filters based on partial orders.
Both theories are combined to prove Chen and Gr√§tzer's construction
theorem for Stone algebras. The latter involves extensive reasoning
about algebraic structures in addition to reasoning in algebraic
structures."""
