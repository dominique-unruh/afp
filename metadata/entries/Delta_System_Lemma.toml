We formalize the basic results on cofinality of linearly ordered sets
and ordinals and Šanin’s Lemma for uncountable families of finite
sets. This last result is used to prove the countable chain condition
for Cohen posets. We work in the set theory framework of Isabelle/ZF,
using the Axiom of Choice as needed."""
