abstract = """
Concentration inequalities provide bounds on how a random variable (or a sum/composition of random variables) deviate from their expectation, usually based on moments/independence of the variables.

The most important concentration inequalities (the Markov, Chebyshev, and Hoelder inequalities and the Chernoff bounds) are already part of HOL-Probability. This entry collects more advanced results, such as Bennett's/Bernstein's Inequality, Bienayme's Identity, Cantelli's Inequality, the Efron-Stein Inequality, McDiarmid's Inequality, and the Paley-Zygmund Inequality."""
