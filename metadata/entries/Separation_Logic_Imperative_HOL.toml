abstract = """
We provide a framework for separation-logic based correctness proofs of
Imperative HOL programs. Our framework comes with a set of proof methods to
automate canonical tasks such as verification condition generation and
frame inference. Moreover, we provide a set of examples that show the
applicability of our framework. The examples include algorithms on lists,
hash-tables, and union-find trees. We also provide abstract interfaces for
lists, maps, and sets, that allow to develop generic imperative algorithms
and use data-refinement techniques.
<br>
As we target Imperative HOL, our programs can be translated to
efficiently executable code in various target languages, including
ML, OCaml, Haskell, and Scala."""
