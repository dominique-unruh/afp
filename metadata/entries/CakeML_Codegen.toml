This entry contains the formalization that accompanies my PhD thesis
(see https://lars.hupel.info/research/codegen/). I develop a verified
compilation toolchain from executable specifications in Isabelle/HOL
to CakeML abstract syntax trees. This improves over the
state-of-the-art in Isabelle by providing a trustworthy procedure for
code generation."""
