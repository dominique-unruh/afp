abstract = """
In 1965, Nash-Williams discovered a generalisation of the infinite
form of Ramsey's theorem. Where the latter concerns infinite sets
of n-element sets for some fixed n, the Nash-Williams theorem concerns
infinite sets of finite sets (or lists) subject to a “no initial
segment” condition. The present formalisation follows a
monograph on Ramsey Spaces by Todorčević."""
