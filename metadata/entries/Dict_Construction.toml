abstract = """
Isabelle's code generator natively supports type classes. For
targets that do not have language support for classes and instances,
it performs the well-known dictionary translation, as described by
Haftmann and Nipkow. This translation happens outside the logic, i.e.,
there is no guarantee that it is correct, besides the pen-and-paper
proof. This work implements a certified dictionary translation that
produces new class-free constants and derives equality theorems."""
