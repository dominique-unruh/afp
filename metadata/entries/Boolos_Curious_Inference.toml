abstract = """
In 1987, George Boolos gave an interesting and vivid concrete example
of the considerable speed-up afforded by higher-order logic over
first-order logic. (A phenomenon first noted by Kurt GÃ¶del in 1936.)
Boolos's example concerned an inference $I$ with five premises,
and a conclusion, such that the shortest derivation of the conclusion
from the premises in a standard system for first-order logic is
astronomically huge; while there exists a second-order derivation
whose length is of the order of a page or two. Boolos gave a short
sketch of that second-order derivation, which relies on the
comprehension principle of second-order logic. Here, Boolos's
inference is formalized into fourteen lemmas, each quickly verified by
the automated-theorem-proving assistant Isabelle/HOL."""
