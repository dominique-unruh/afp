This development provides a general definition for safe Regression
Test Selection (RTS) algorithms. RTS algorithms select which tests to
rerun on revised code, reducing the time required to check for newly
introduced errors. An RTS algorithm is considered safe if and only if
all deselected tests would have unchanged results.  This definition is
instantiated with two class-collection-based RTS algorithms run over
the JVM as modeled by JinjaDCI. This is achieved with a general
definition for Collection Semantics, small-step semantics instrumented
to collect information during execution. As the RTS definition
mandates safety, these instantiations include proofs of safety.  This
work is described in Mansky and Gunter's LSFA 2020 paper and
Mansky's doctoral thesis (UIUC, 2020)."""
