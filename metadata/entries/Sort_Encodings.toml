abstract = """
This is a formalization of the soundness and completeness properties
for various efficient encodings of sorts in unsorted first-order logic
used by Isabelle's Sledgehammer tool.
<p>
Essentially, the encodings proceed as follows:
a many-sorted problem is decorated with (as few as possible) tags or
guards that make the problem monotonic; then sorts can be soundly
erased.
<p>
The development employs a formalization of many-sorted first-order logic
in clausal form (clauses, structures and the basic properties
of the satisfaction relation), which could be of interest as the starting
point for other formalizations of first-order logic metatheory."""
