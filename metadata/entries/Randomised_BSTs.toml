abstract = """
<p>This work is a formalisation of the Randomised Binary Search
Trees introduced by Mart√≠nez and Roura, including definitions and
correctness proofs.</p> <p>Like randomised treaps, they
are a probabilistic data structure that behaves exactly as if elements
were inserted into a non-balancing BST in random order. However,
unlike treaps, they only use discrete probability distributions, but
their use of randomness is more complicated.</p>"""
