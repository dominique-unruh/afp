abstract = """
<p>We formalize the Berlekamp-Zassenhaus algorithm for factoring
square-free integer polynomials in Isabelle/HOL. We further adapt an
existing formalization of Yun’s square-free factorization algorithm to
integer polynomials, and thus provide an efficient and certified
factorization algorithm for arbitrary univariate polynomials.
</p>
<p>The algorithm first performs a factorization in the prime field GF(p) and
then performs computations in the integer ring modulo p^k, where both
p and k are determined at runtime. Since a natural modeling of these
structures via dependent types is not possible in Isabelle/HOL, we
formalize the whole algorithm using Isabelle’s recent addition of
local type definitions.
</p>
<p>Through experiments we verify that our algorithm factors polynomials of degree
100 within seconds.
