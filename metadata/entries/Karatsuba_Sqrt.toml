abstract = """
<p>This formalisation provides an executable version of Zimmerman's &ldquo;Karatsuba Square Root&rdquo;
algorithm, which, given an integer $n \\geq 0$, computes the integer square root
$\\lfloor \\sqrt{n}\\rfloor$ and the remainder $n - \\lfloor \\sqrt{n}\\rfloor^2$.
This is the algorithm used by the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP).</p>
<p>Similarly to Karatsuba multiplication, the algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that
works by repeatedly splitting the input number $n$ into four parts and recursively calls
itself once on an input with roughly half as many bits as $n$, leading to a total running time
of $O(M(n))$ (where $M(n)$ is the time required to multiply two $n$-bit numbers).
This is significantly faster than the standard Heron method for large numbers (i.e. more than
roughly 1000 bits).</p>
<p>As a simple application to interval arithmetic, an executable floating-point interval 
extension of the square-root operation is provided. For high-precision computations this 
is considerably more efficient than the interval extension method in the Isabelle distribution.</p>"""
