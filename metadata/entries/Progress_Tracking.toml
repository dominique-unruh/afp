abstract = """
Large-scale stream processing systems often follow the dataflow
paradigm, which enforces a program structure that exposes a high
degree of parallelism. The Timely Dataflow distributed system supports
expressive cyclic dataflows for which it offers low-latency data- and
pipeline-parallel stream processing. To achieve high expressiveness
and performance, Timely Dataflow uses an intricate distributed
protocol for tracking the computationâ€™s progress. We formalize this
progress tracking protocol and verify its safety. Our formalization is
described in detail in our forthcoming <a

paper</a>."""
