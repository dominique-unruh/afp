abstract = """
Isabelle/UTP is a mechanised theory engineering toolkit based on Hoare
and Heâ€™s Unifying Theories of Programming (UTP). UTP enables the
creation of denotational, algebraic, and operational semantics for
different programming languages using an alphabetised relational
calculus. We provide a semantic embedding of the alphabetised
relational calculus in Isabelle/HOL, including new type definitions,
relational constructors, automated proof tactics, and accompanying
algebraic laws. Isabelle/UTP can be used to both capture laws of
programming for different languages, and put these fundamental
theorems to work in the creation of associated verification tools,
using calculi like Hoare logics. This document describes the
relational core of the UTP in Isabelle/HOL."""
