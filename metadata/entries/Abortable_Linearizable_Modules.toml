abstract = """
We define the Abortable Linearizable Module automaton (ALM for short)
and prove its key composition property using the IOA theory of
HOLCF. The ALM is at the heart of the Speculative Linearizability
framework. This framework simplifies devising correct speculative
algorithms by enabling their decomposition into independent modules
that can be analyzed and proved correct in isolation. It is
particularly useful when working in a distributed environment, where
the need to tolerate faults and asynchrony has made current
monolithic protocols so intricate that it is no longer tractable to
check their correctness. Our theory contains a typical example of a
refinement proof in the I/O-automata framework of Lynch and Tuttle."""
