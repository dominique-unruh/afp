<p>This article formalizes signature-based algorithms for computing
Gr&ouml;bner bases. Such algorithms are, in general, superior to
other algorithms in terms of efficiency, and have not been formalized
in any proof assistant so far. The present development is both
generic, in the sense that most known variants of signature-based
algorithms are covered by it, and effectively executable on concrete
input thanks to Isabelle's code generator. Sample computations of
benchmark problems show that the verified implementation of
signature-based algorithms indeed outperforms the existing
implementation of Buchberger's algorithm in Isabelle/HOL.</p>
<p>Besides total correctness of the algorithms, the article also proves
that under certain conditions they a-priori detect and avoid all
useless zero-reductions, and always return 'minimal' (in
some sense) Gr&ouml;bner bases if an input parameter is chosen in
the right way.</p><p>The formalization follows the recent survey article by
Eder and Faug&egrave;re.</p>"""
