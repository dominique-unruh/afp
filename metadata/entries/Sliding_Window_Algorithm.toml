Basin et al.'s <a
href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipl.2014.09.009\">sliding
window algorithm (SWA)</a> is an algorithm for combining the
elements of subsequences of a sequence with an associative operator.
It is greedy and minimizes the number of operator applications. We
formalize the algorithm and verify its functional correctness. We
extend the algorithm with additional operations and provide an
alternative interface to the slide operation that does not require the
entire input sequence."""
