abstract = """
We present a formalization of push-relabel algorithms for computing
the maximum flow in a network. We start with Goldberg's et
al.~generic push-relabel algorithm, for which we show correctness and
the time complexity bound of O(V^2E). We then derive the
relabel-to-front and FIFO implementation. Using stepwise refinement
techniques, we derive an efficient verified implementation.  Our
formal proof of the abstract algorithms closely follows a standard
textbook proof. It is accessible even without being an expert in
Isabelle/HOL, the interactive theorem prover used for the
formalization."""
