<p>Hyperdual numbers are ones with a real component and a number
of infinitesimal components, usually written as $a_0 + a_1 \\cdot
\\epsilon_1 + a_2 \\cdot \\epsilon_2 + a_3 \\cdot \\epsilon_1\\epsilon_2$.
They have been proposed by <a
href=\"https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2011-886\">Fike and
Alonso</a> in an approach to automatic
differentiation.</p> <p>In this entry we formalise
hyperdual numbers and their application to forward differentiation. We
show them to be an instance of multiple algebraic structures and then,
along with facts about twice-differentiability, we define what we call
the hyperdual extensions of functions on real-normed fields. This
extension formally represents the proposed way that the first and
second derivatives of a function can be automatically calculated. We
demonstrate it on the standard logistic function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{1 +
e^{-x}}$ and also reproduce the example analytic function $f(x) =
\\frac{e^x}{\\sqrt{sin(x)^3 + cos(x)^3}}$ used for demonstration by Fike
and Alonso.</p>"""
