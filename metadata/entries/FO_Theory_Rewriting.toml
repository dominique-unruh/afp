abstract = """
The first-order theory of rewriting (FORT) is a decidable theory for
linear variable-separated rewrite systems. The decision procedure is
based on tree automata technique and an inference system presented in
\"Certifying Proofs in the First-Order Theory of Rewriting\".
This AFP entry provides a formalization of the underlying decision
procedure. Moreover it allows to generate a function that can verify
each inference step via the code generation facility of Isabelle/HOL.
Additionally it contains the specification of a certificate language
(that allows to state proofs in FORT) and a formalized function that
allows to verify the validity of the proof. This gives software tool
authors, that implement the decision procedure, the possibility to
verify their output."""
