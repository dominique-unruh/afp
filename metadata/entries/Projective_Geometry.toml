abstract = """
We formalize the basics of projective geometry. In particular, we give
a proof of the so-called Hessenberg's theorem in projective plane
geometry. We also provide a proof of the so-called Desargues's
theorem based on an axiomatization of (higher) projective space
geometry using the notion of rank of a matroid. This last approach
allows to handle incidence relations in an homogeneous way dealing
only with points and without the need of talking explicitly about
lines, planes or any higher entity."""
