abstract = """
The focus of this case study is re-use in abstract algebra.  It
contains locale-based formalisations of selected parts of set, group
and ring theory from Jacobson's <i>Basic Algebra</i>
leading to the respective fundamental homomorphism theorems.  The
study is not intended as a library base for abstract algebra.  It
rather explores an approach towards abstract algebra in Isabelle."""
