<p>We give a formal proof of the well-known results about the
number of comparisons performed by two variants of QuickSort: first,
the expected number of comparisons of randomised QuickSort
(i.&thinsp;e.&nbsp;QuickSort with random pivot choice) is
<em>2&thinsp;(n+1)&thinsp;H<sub>n</sub> -
4&thinsp;n</em>, which is asymptotically equivalent to
<em>2&thinsp;n ln n</em>; second, the number of
comparisons performed by the classic non-randomised QuickSort has the
same distribution in the average case as the randomised one.</p>"""
