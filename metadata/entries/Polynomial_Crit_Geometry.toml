<p>
This entry formalises two well-known results about the geometric relation between the <em>roots</em>
of a complex polynomial and its <em>critical points</em>, i.e. the roots of its derivative.</p>
<p>The first of these is the <em>Gauß–Lucas Theorem</em>: The critical points of a 
complex polynomial lie inside the convex hull of its roots.</p>
<p>The second one is <em>Jensen's Theorem</em>: Every non-real critical point of a
real polynomial lies inside a disc between two conjugate roots. These discs are called the <em>Jensen discs</em>: the Jensen disc of a pair of conjugate roots $a \\pm b i$ is the smallest disc that contains both of them, i.e. the disc with centre $a$ and 
radius $b$.</p>"""
