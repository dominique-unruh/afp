The theory of partition relations concerns generalisations of
Ramsey's theorem. For any ordinal $\\alpha$, write $\\alpha \\to
(\\alpha, m)^2$ if for each function $f$ from unordered pairs of
elements of $\\alpha$ into $\\{0,1\\}$, either there is a subset
$X\\subseteq \\alpha$ order-isomorphic to $\\alpha$ such that
$f\\{x,y\\}=0$ for all $\\{x,y\\}\\subseteq X$, or there is an $m$ element
set $Y\\subseteq \\alpha$ such that $f\\{x,y\\}=1$ for all
$\\{x,y\\}\\subseteq Y$. (In both cases, with $\\{x,y\\}$ we require
$x\\not=y$.) In particular, the infinite Ramsey theorem can be written
in this notation as $\\omega \\to (\\omega, \\omega)^2$, or if we
restrict $m$ to the positive integers as above, then $\\omega \\to
(\\omega, m)^2$ for all $m$.  This entry formalises Larson's proof
of $\\omega^\\omega \\to (\\omega^\\omega, m)^2$ along with a similar proof
of a result due to Specker: $\\omega^2 \\to (\\omega^2, m)^2$. Also
proved is a necessary result by Erd≈ës and Milner:
$\\omega^{1+\\alpha\\cdot n} \\to (\\omega^{1+\\alpha}, 2^n)^2$."""
