This theory provides a verified implementation of weight-balanced
trees following the work of <a
href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0956796811000104\">Hirai
and Yamamoto</a> who proved that all parameters in a certain
range are valid, i.e. guarantee that insertion and deletion preserve
weight-balance. Instead of a general theorem we provide parameterized
proofs of preservation of the invariant that work for many (all?)
valid parameters."""
