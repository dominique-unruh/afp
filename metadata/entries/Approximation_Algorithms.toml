We present the first formal verification of approximation algorithms
for NP-complete optimization problems: vertex cover, set cover, independent set,
center selection, load balancing, and bin packing. The proofs correct incompletenesses
in existing proofs and improve the approximation ratio in one case.
A detailed description of our work (excluding center selection) has been published in the proceedings of
<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-51054-1_17\">IJCAR 2020</a>."""
