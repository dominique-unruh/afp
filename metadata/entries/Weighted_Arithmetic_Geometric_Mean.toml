abstract = """
<p>This article provides a formalisation of the Weighted
Arithmetic–Geometric Mean Inequality: given non-negative reals $a_1,
\\ldots, a_n$ and non-negative weights $w_1, \\ldots, w_n$ such that
$w_1 + \\ldots + w_n = 1$, we have \\[\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n a_i^{w_i}
\\leq \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n w_i a_i\\ .\\] If the weights are additionally
all non-zero, equality holds if and only if $a_1 = \\ldots =
a_n$.</p> <p>As a corollary with $w_1 = \\ldots = w_n =
1/n$, the regular arithmetic–geometric mean inequality follows, namely
that \\[\\sqrt[n]{a_1\\,\\cdots\\, a_n} \\leq \\tfrac{1}{n}(a_1 + \\ldots +
a_n)\\ .\\]</p> <p>I follow Pólya's elegant proof,
which uses the inequality $1 + x \\leq e^x$ as a starting point. Pólya
claims that this proof came to him in a dream, and that it was “the
best mathematics he had ever dreamt.”</p>"""
