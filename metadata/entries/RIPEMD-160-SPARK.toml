abstract = "This work presents a verification of an implementation in SPARK/ADA of the cryptographic hash-function RIPEMD-160. A functional specification of RIPEMD-160 is given in Isabelle/HOL. Proofs for the verification conditions generated by the static-analysis toolset of SPARK certify the functional correctness of the implementation."
