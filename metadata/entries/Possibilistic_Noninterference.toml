abstract = """
We formalize a wide variety of Volpano/Smith-style  noninterference
notions for a while language with parallel composition.
We systematize and classify these notions according to
compositionality w.r.t. the language constructs. Compositionality
yields sound syntactic criteria (a.k.a. type systems) in a uniform way.
<p>
An <a href=\"http://www21.in.tum.de/~nipkow/pubs/cpp12.html\">article</a>
about these proofs is published in the proceedings
of the conference Certified Programs and Proofs 2012."""
