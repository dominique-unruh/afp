abstract = """
<p>Formal Puiseux series are generalisations of formal power
series and formal Laurent series that also allow for fractional
exponents. They have the following general form: \\[\\sum_{i=N}^\\infty
a_{i/d} X^{i/d}\\] where <em>N</em> is an integer and
<em>d</em> is a positive integer.</p> <p>This
entry defines these series including their basic algebraic properties.
Furthermore, it proves the Newtonâ€“Puiseux Theorem, namely that the
Puiseux series over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0
are also algebraically closed.</p>"""
