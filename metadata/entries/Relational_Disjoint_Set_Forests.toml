abstract = """
We give a simple relation-algebraic semantics of read and write
operations on associative arrays. The array operations seamlessly
integrate with assignments in the Hoare-logic library. Using relation
algebras and Kleene algebras we verify the correctness of an
array-based implementation of disjoint-set forests with a naive union
operation and a find operation with path compression."""
