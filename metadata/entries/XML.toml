This entry provides an XML library for Isabelle/HOL. This includes parsing
and pretty printing of XML trees as well as combinators for transforming XML
trees into arbitrary user-defined data. The main contribution of this entry is
an interface (fit for code generation) that allows for communication between
verified programs formalized in Isabelle/HOL and the outside world via XML.
This library was developed as part of the IsaFoR/CeTA project
to which we refer for examples of its usage."""
