abstract = """
The following document formalizes and verifies several architectural
design patterns. Each pattern specification is formalized in terms of
a locale where the locale assumptions correspond to the assumptions
which a pattern poses on an architecture. Thus, pattern specifications
may build on top of each other by interpreting the corresponding
locale. A pattern is verified using the framework provided by the AFP
entry Dynamic Architectures. Currently, the document consists of
formalizations of 4 different patterns: the singleton, the publisher
subscriber, the blackboard pattern, and the blockchain pattern.
Thereby, the publisher component of the publisher subscriber pattern
is modeled as an instance of the singleton pattern and the blackboard
pattern is modeled as an instance of the publisher subscriber pattern.
In general, this entry provides the first steps towards an overall
theory of architectural design patterns."""
