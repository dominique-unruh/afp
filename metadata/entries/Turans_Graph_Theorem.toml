abstract = """
<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tur%C3%A1n%27s_theorem\">Turán's Graph Theorem</a> states that any undirected, simple graph with $n$ vertices that does not contain a $p$-clique, contains at most $\\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{p-1} \\right) \\frac{n^2}{2}$ edges.
The theorem is an important result in graph theory and the foundation of the field of extremal graph theory.

The formalisation follows Aigner and Ziegler's presentation in <i>Proofs from THE BOOK</i> of Turán's initial proof.
Besides a direct adaptation of the textbook proof, a simplified, second proof is presented which decreases the size of the formalised proof significantly."""
