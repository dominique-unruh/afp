This entry provides a type class for <em>perfect fields</em>. 
A perfect field <i>K</i> can be characterized by one of the following equivalent conditions:
<ul>
<li> Any irreducible polynomial <i>p</i> is separable, i.e. <i>gcd(p,p') = 1</i>, or, equivalently, <i>p'</i> non-zero.</li>
<li> Either the characteristic of <i>K</i> is 0 or <i>p > 0</i> and the Frobenius endomorphism is surjective (i.e. every element of <i>K</i> has a <i>p</i>-th root).</li>
</ul>
We define perfect fields using the second characterization and show the equivalence to the first characterization.
The implication ``2 => 1'' is relatively straightforward using the injectivity of the Frobenius homomorphism.

Examples for perfect fields are:
<ul>
<li> any field of characteristic 0 (e.g. the reals or complex numbers)</li>
<li> any finite field (i.e. <i>F<sub>q</sub></i> for <i>q=p<sup>n</sup></i>, <i>n > 0</i> and <i>p</i> prime)</li>
<li> any algebraically closed field</li>
</ul>"""
