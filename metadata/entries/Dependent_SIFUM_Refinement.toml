abstract = """
The paper \"Compositional Verification and Refinement of Concurrent
Value-Dependent Noninterference\" by Murray et. al. (CSF 2016) presents
a compositional theory of refinement for a value-dependent
noninterference property, defined in (Murray, PLAS 2015), for
concurrent programs. This development formalises that refinement
theory, and demonstrates its application on some small examples."""
