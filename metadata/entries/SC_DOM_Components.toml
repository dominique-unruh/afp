abstract = """
While the (safely composable) DOM with shadow trees provide the
technical basis for defining web components, it does neither defines
the concept of web components nor specifies the safety properties that
web components should guarantee. Consequently, the standard also does
not discuss how or even if the methods for modifying the DOM respect
component boundaries. In AFP entry, we present a formally verified
model of safely composable web components and define safety properties
which ensure that different web components can only interact with each
other using well-defined interfaces. Moreover, our verification of the
application programming interface (API) of the DOM revealed numerous
invariants that implementations of the DOM API need to preserve to
ensure the integrity of components.  In comparison to the strict
standard compliance formalization of Web Components in the AFP entry
\"DOM_Components\", the notion of components in this entry
(based on \"SC_DOM\" and \"Shadow_SC_DOM\") provides
much stronger safety guarantees."""
