This Isabelle/HOL formalization extends the AFP entry
<em>Saturation_Framework</em> with the following
contributions:  <ul> <li>an application of the framework
to prove Bachmair and Ganzinger's resolution prover RP
refutationally complete, which was formalized in a more ad hoc fashion
by Schlichtkrull et al. in the AFP entry
<em>Ordered_Resultion_Prover</em>;</li>
<li>generalizations of various basic concepts formalized by
Schlichtkrull et al., which were needed to verify RP and could be
useful to formalize other calculi, such as superposition;</li>
<li>alternative proofs of fairness (and hence saturation and
ultimately refutational completeness) for the given clause procedures
GC and LGC, based on invariance.</li> </ul>"""
