We validate an abstract formulation of G&ouml;del's First and
Second Incompleteness Theorems from a <a
href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Goedel_Incompleteness.html\">separate
AFP entry</a> by instantiating them to the case of
<i>finite sound extensions of the Hereditarily Finite (HF) Set
theory</i>, i.e., FOL theories extending the HF Set theory with
a finite set of axioms that are sound in the standard model. The
concrete results had been previously formalised in an <a
href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Incompleteness.html\">AFP
entry by Larry Paulson</a>; our instantiation reuses the
infrastructure developed in that entry."""
