<p>Intransitive noninterference has been a widely studied topic in the last
few decades. Several well-established methodologies apply interactive
theorem proving to formulate a noninterference theorem over abstract
academic models. In joint work with several industrial and academic partners
throughout Europe, we are helping in the certification process of PikeOS, an
industrial separation kernel developed at SYSGO. In this process,
established theories could not be applied. We present a new generic model of
separation kernels and a new theory of intransitive noninterference. The
model is rich in detail, making it suitable for formal verification of
realistic and industrial systems such as PikeOS. Using a refinement-based
theorem proving approach, we ensure that proofs remain manageable.</p>
