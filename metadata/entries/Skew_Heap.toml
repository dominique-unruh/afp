abstract = """
Skew heaps are an amazingly simple and lightweight implementation of
priority queues. They were invented by Sleator and Tarjan [SIAM 1986]
and have logarithmic amortized complexity. This entry provides executable
and verified functional skew heaps.
<p>
The amortized complexity of skew heaps is analyzed in the AFP entry
<a href=\"http://isa-afp.org/entries/Amortized_Complexity.html\">Amortized Complexity</a>."""
