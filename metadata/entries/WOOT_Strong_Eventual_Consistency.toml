Commutative Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) are a promising new class of
data structures for large-scale shared mutable content in applications
that only require eventual consistency. The WithOut Operational
Transforms (WOOT) framework is a CRDT for collaborative text editing
introduced by Oster et al. (CSCW 2006) for which the eventual
consistency property was verified only for a bounded model to date. We
contribute a formal proof for WOOTs strong eventual consistency."""
