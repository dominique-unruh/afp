<p> The AFP entry <a
href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Abstract_Completeness.html\">Abstract
Completeness</a> by Blanchette, Popescu and Traytel formalizes
the core of Beth/Hintikka-style completeness proofs for first-order
logic and can be used to formalize executable sequent calculus
provers. In the Journal of Automated Reasoning, the authors
instantiate the framework with a sequent calculus for first-order
logic and prove its completeness. Their use of an infinite set of
proof rules indexed by formulas yields very direct arguments. A fair
stream of these rules controls the prover, making its definition
remarkably simple. The AFP entry, however, only contains a toy example
for propositional logic. The AFP entry <a
href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/FOL_Seq_Calc2.html\">A
Sequent Calculus Prover for First-Order Logic with Functions</a>
by From and Jacobsen also uses the framework, but uses a finite set of
generic rules resulting in a more sophisticated prover with more
complicated proofs. </p> <p> This entry contains an
executable sequent calculus prover for first-order logic with
functions in the style presented by Blanchette et al. The prover can
be exported to Haskell and this entry includes formalized proofs of
its soundness and completeness. The proofs are simpler than those for
the prover by From and Jacobsen but the performance of the prover is
significantly worse. </p> <p> The included theory
<em>Fair-Stream</em> first proves that the sequence of
natural numbers 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, etc. is fair. It then proves that
mapping any surjective function across the sequence preserves
fairness. This method of obtaining a fair stream of rules is similar
to the one given by Blanchette et al. The concrete functions from
natural numbers to terms, formulas and rules are defined using the
<em>Nat-Bijection</em> theory in the HOL-Library.
