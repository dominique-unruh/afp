This AFP entry provides mathematical components for modal quantales,
  involutive quantales and Dedekind quantales. Modal quantales are
  simple extensions of modal Kleene algebras useful for the
  verification of recursive programs. Involutive quantales appear in
  the study of C*-algebras. Dedekind quantales are relatives of
  Tarski's relation algebras, hence relevant to program verification
  and beyond that to higher  rewriting. We also provide
  components for weaker variants such as Kleene algebras with converse
  and modal Kleene algebras with converse."""
