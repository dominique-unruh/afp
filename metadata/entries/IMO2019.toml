<p>This entry contains formalisations of the answers to three of
the six problem of the International Mathematical Olympiad 2019,
namely Q1, Q4, and Q5.</p> <p>The reason why these
problems were chosen is that they are particularly amenable to
formalisation: they can be solved with minimal use of libraries. The
remaining three concern geometry and graph theory, which, in the
author's opinion, are more difficult to formalise resp. require a
more complex library.</p>"""
