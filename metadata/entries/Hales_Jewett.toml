<p>This article is a formalisation of a proof of the
Hales--Jewett theorem presented in the textbook <em>Ramsey
Theory</em> by Graham et al.</p>
<p>The Hales--Jewett theorem is a result in Ramsey Theory which
states that, for any non-negative integers $r$ and $t$, there exists a
minimal dimension $N$, such that any $r$-coloured
$N'$-dimensional cube over $t$ elements (with $N' \\geq N$)
contains a monochromatic line. This theorem generalises Van der
Waerden's Theorem, which has already been formalised in another

entry</a>.</p>"""
