abstract = "This theory formalises the compactness theorem for propositional logic based on the model existence theorem approach. It also presents applications of compactness theorem to formalize combinatorial the- orems over countable structures: the De Bruijn-Erdös Graph color- ing theorem for countable graphs, König Lemma, and set- and graph- theoretical versions of Hall’s Theorem for countable families of sets and graphs."
