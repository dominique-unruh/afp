This work formalizes the Myhill-Nerode theorems for \\(G\\)-automata and nominal \\(G\\)-automata.
The Myhill-Nerode theorem for (nominal) \\(G\\)-automata states that, given \\(A\\) an orbit finite (nominal) \\(G\\)-set and a \\(G\\)-language \\(L \\subseteq A^{\\ast}\\), the following are equivalent:<br>
<ul>
  <li>The set of equivalence classes of \\(L{/}\\equiv_{\\text{MN}}\\), with respect to the Myhill-Nerode equivalence relation, \\(\\equiv_{\\text{MN}}\\), is orbit finite.</li>
  <li>\\(L\\) is recognized by a deterministic (nominal) \\(G\\)-automaton with an orbit finite set of states.</li>
</ul>
The proofs formalized are based on on those from <a href=\"https://lmcs.episciences.org/1157\">an article by M. Bojanczyk, B. Klin and S. Lasota.</a>"""
