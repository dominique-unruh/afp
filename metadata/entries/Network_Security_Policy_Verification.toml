abstract = """
We present a unified theory for verifying network security policies.
A security policy is represented as directed graph.
To check high-level security goals, security invariants over the policy are
expressed. We cover monotonic security invariants, i.e. prohibiting more does not harm
security. We provide the following contributions for the security invariant theory.
<ul>
<li>Secure auto-completion of scenario-specific knowledge, which eases usability.</li>
<li>Security violations can be repaired by tightening the policy iff the
security invariants hold for the deny-all policy.</li>
<li>An algorithm to compute a security policy.</li>
<li>A formalization of stateful connection semantics in network security mechanisms.</li>
<li>An algorithm to compute a secure stateful implementation of a policy.</li>
<li>An executable implementation of all the theory.</li>
<li>Examples, ranging from an aircraft cabin data network to the analysis
of a large real-world firewall.</li>
<li>More examples: A fully automated translation of high-level security goals to both
firewall and SDN configurations (see Examples/Distributed_WebApp.thy).</li>
