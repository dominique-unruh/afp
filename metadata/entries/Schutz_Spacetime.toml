abstract = """
This is a formalisation of Schutz' system of axioms for Minkowski
spacetime published under the name \"Independent axioms for
Minkowski space-time\" in 1997, as well as most of the results in
the third chapter (\"Temporal Order on a Path\") of the above
monograph. Many results are proven here that cannot be found in
Schutz, either preceding the theorem they are needed for, or within
their own thematic section."""
