abstract = """
This entry formalizes the Laplace transform and concrete Laplace
transforms for arithmetic functions, frequency shift, integration and
(higher) differentiation in the time domain. It proves Lerch's
lemma and uniqueness of the Laplace transform for continuous
functions. In order to formalize the foundational assumptions, this
entry contains a formalization of piecewise continuous functions and
functions of exponential order."""
