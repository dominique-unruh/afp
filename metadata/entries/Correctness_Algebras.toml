abstract = """
We study models of state-based non-deterministic sequential
computations and describe them using algebras. We propose algebras
that describe iteration for strict and non-strict computations. They
unify computation models which differ in the fixpoints used to
represent iteration. We propose algebras that describe the infinite
executions of a computation. They lead to a unified approximation
order and results that connect fixpoints in the approximation and
refinement orders. This unifies the semantics of recursion for a range
of computation models. We propose algebras that describe preconditions
and the effect of while-programs under postconditions. They unify
correctness statements in two dimensions: one statement applies in
various computation models to various correctness claims."""
