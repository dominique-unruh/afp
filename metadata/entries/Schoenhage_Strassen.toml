abstract = """
We give a verified implementation of the Schönhage-Strassen Multiplication on Integers based on the original paper by Schönhage and Strassen and verify its asymptotic complexity of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n \\log n \\log \\log n\\right)$ bit operations.

Integers are represented as LSBF (least significant bit first) boolean lists. The running time is verified using the Time Monad defined in Root-Balanced Trees by Nipkow. For verifying correctness, we adapt the formalization of Number Theoretic Transforms (NTTs) by Ammer and Kreuzer to the context of rings that need not be fields."""
