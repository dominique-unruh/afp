<p>We present a certified declarative first-order prover with equality
based on John Harrison's Handbook of Practical Logic and
Automated Reasoning, Cambridge University Press, 2009. ML code
reflection is used such that the entire prover can be executed within
Isabelle as a very simple interactive proof assistant. As examples we
consider Pelletier's problems 1-46.</p>
