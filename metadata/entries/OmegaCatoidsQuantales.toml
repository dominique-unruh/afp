abstract = """
We formalise strict 2-catoids, 2-categories, 2-Kleene algebras
  and 2-quantales, as well as their omega-variants. Due to
  strictness, the cells of these higher categories have globular
  shape. We use a single-set approach, generalised to catoids and
  based on type classes. The higher Kleene algebras and quantales
  introduced extend features of modal and concurrent Kleene algebras
  and quantales. They arise for instance as powerset extensions of
  higher catoids, and have been used in algebraic confluence proofs in
  higher-dimensional rewriting. Details are described in two companion
  articles."""
