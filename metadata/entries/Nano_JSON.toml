abstract = """
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a common format for exchanging
data, based on a collection of key/value-pairs (the JSON objects) and
lists. Its syntax is inspired by JavaScript with the aim of being easy
to read and write for humans and easy to parse and generate for
machines.  Despite its origin in the JavaScript world, JSON is
language-independent and many programming languages support working
with JSON-encoded data. This makes JSON an interesting format for
exchanging data with Isabelle/HOL.  This AFP entry provides a
JSON-like import-expert format for both Isabelle/ML and Isabelle/HOL.
On the one hand, this AFP entry provides means for Isabelle/HOL users
to work with JSON encoded data without the need using Isabelle/ML. On
the other and, the provided Isabelle/ML interfaces allow additional
extensions or integration into Isabelle extensions written in
Isabelle/ML. While format is not fully JSON compliant (e.g., due to
limitations in the range of supported Unicode characters), it works in
most situations: the provided implementation in Isabelle/ML and its
representation in Isabelle/HOL have been used successfully in several
projects for exchanging data sets of several hundredths of megabyte
between Isabelle and external tools."""
