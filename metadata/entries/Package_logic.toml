abstract = """
The magic wand $\\mathbin{-\\!\\!*}$ (also called separating
implication) is a separation logic connective commonly used to specify
properties of partial data structures, for instance during iterative
traversals. A <em>footprint</em> of a magic wand formula
$$A \\mathbin{-\\!\\!*} B$$ is a state that, combined with any state in
which $A$ holds, yields a state in which $B$ holds. The key
challenge of proving a magic wand (also called
<em>packaging</em> a wand) is to find such a footprint.
Existing package algorithms either have a high annotation overhead or
are unsound.  In this entry, we formally define a framework for the
sound automation of magic wands, described in an <a href=\"https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~alexsumm/papers/DardinierParthasarathyWeeksMuellerSummers22.pdf\">upcoming
paper at CAV 2022</a>, and prove that it is sound and complete.
This framework, called the <em>package logic</em>,
precisely characterises a wide design space of possible package
algorithms applicable to a large class of separation logics."""
