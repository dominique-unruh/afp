We implement and prove correct binomial heaps and skew binomial heaps.
Both are data-structures for priority queues.
While binomial heaps have logarithmic <em>findMin</em>, <em>deleteMin</em>,
<em>insert</em>, and <em>meld</em> operations,
skew binomial heaps have constant time <em>findMin</em>, <em>insert</em>,
and <em>meld</em> operations, and only the <em>deleteMin</em>-operation is
logarithmic. This is achieved by using <em>skew links</em> to avoid
cascading linking on <em>insert</em>-operations, and <em>data-structural
bootstrapping</em> to get constant-time <em>findMin</em> and <em>meld</em>
operations.  Our implementation follows the paper by Brodal and Okasaki."""
