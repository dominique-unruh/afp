abstract = """
Isabelle/Isar provides named cases to structure proofs. This article
contains an implementation of a proof method <tt>casify</tt>, which can
be used to easily extend proof tools with support for named cases. Such
a proof tool must produce labeled subgoals, which are then interpreted
by <tt>casify</tt>.
<p>
As examples, this work contains verification condition generators
producing named cases for three languages: The Hoare language from
<tt>HOL/Library</tt>, a monadic language for computations with failure
(inspired by the AutoCorres tool), and a language of conditional
expressions. These VCGs are demonstrated by a number of example programs."""
