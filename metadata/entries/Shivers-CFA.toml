abstract = """
In his dissertation, Olin Shivers introduces a concept of control flow graphs
for functional languages, provides an algorithm to statically derive a safe
approximation of the control flow graph and proves this algorithm correct. In
this research project, Shivers' algorithms and proofs are formalized
in the HOLCF extension of HOL."""
