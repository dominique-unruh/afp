abstract = """
In protocol verification we observe a wide spectrum from fully
automated methods to interactive theorem proving with proof assistants
like Isabelle/HOL. In this AFP entry, we present a fully-automated
approach for verifying stateful security protocols, i.e., protocols
with mutable state that may span several sessions. The approach
supports reachability goals like secrecy and authentication. We also
include a simple user-friendly transaction-based protocol
specification language that is embedded into Isabelle."""
