<p>The Lambert <em>W</em> function is a multi-valued
function defined as the inverse function of <em>x</em>
&#x21A6; <em>x</em>
e<sup><em>x</em></sup>. Besides numerous
applications in combinatorics, physics, and engineering, it also
frequently occurs when solving equations containing both
e<sup><em>x</em></sup> and
<em>x</em>, or both <em>x</em> and log
<em>x</em>.</p> <p>This article provides a
definition of the two real-valued branches
<em>W</em><sub>0</sub>(<em>x</em>)
and
<em>W</em><sub>-1</sub>(<em>x</em>)
and proves various properties such as basic identities and
inequalities, monotonicity, differentiability, asymptotic expansions,
and the MacLaurin series of
<em>W</em><sub>0</sub>(<em>x</em>)
at <em>x</em> = 0.</p>"""
