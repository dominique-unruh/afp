We present LOFT — Linux firewall OpenFlow Translator, a system that
transforms the main routing table and FORWARD chain of iptables of a
Linux-based firewall into a set of static OpenFlow rules. Our
implementation is verified against a model of a simplified Linux-based
router and we can directly show how much of the original functionality
is preserved."""
