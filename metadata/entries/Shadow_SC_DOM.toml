abstract = """
In this AFP entry, we extend our formalization of the safely
composable DOM with Shadow Roots. This is a proposal for Shadow Roots
with stricter safety guarantess than the standard compliant
formalization (see \"Shadow DOM\"). Shadow Roots are a recent
proposal of the web community to support a component-based development
approach for client-side web applications.  Shadow roots are a
significant extension to the DOM standard and, as web standards are
condemned to be backward compatible, such extensions often result in
complex specification that may contain unwanted subtleties that can be
detected by a formalization.  Our Isabelle/HOL formalization is, in
the sense of object-orientation, an extension of our formalization of
the core DOM and enjoys the same basic properties, i.e., it is
extensible, i.e., can be extended without the need of re-proving
already proven properties and executable, i.e., we can generate
executable code from our specification. We exploit the executability
to show that our formalization complies to the official standard of
the W3C, respectively, the WHATWG."""
