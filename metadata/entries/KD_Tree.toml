This entry provides a formalization of multidimensional binary trees,
also known as k-d trees. It includes a balanced build algorithm as
well as the nearest neighbor algorithm and the range search algorithm.
It is based on the papers <a
href=\"https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=361002.361007\">Multidimensional
binary search trees used for associative searching</a> and <a
href=\"https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=355744.355745\">
An Algorithm for Finding Best Matches in Logarithmic Expected
Time</a>."""
