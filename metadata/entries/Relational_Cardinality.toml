abstract = "In relation algebras, which model unweighted graphs, the cardinality operation counts the number of edges of a graph. We generalise the cardinality axioms to Stone relation algebras, which model weighted graphs, and study the relationships between various axioms for cardinality. We also give a representation theorem for Stone relation algebras."
