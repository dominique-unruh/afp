abstract = """
This is a formalization of bounded-deducibility security (BD
security), a flexible notion of information-flow security applicable
to arbitrary transition systems. It generalizes Sutherland's
classic notion of nondeducibility by factoring in declassification
bounds and trigger, whereas nondeducibility states that, in a
system, information cannot flow between specified sources and sinks,
BD security indicates upper bounds for the flow and triggers under
which these upper bounds are no longer guaranteed."""
