abstract = """
This is a formalization of bounded-deducibility security (BD
security), a flexible notion of information-flow security applicable
to arbitrary transition systems. It generalizes Sutherland's
classic notion of nondeducibility by factoring in declassification
bounds and trigger, whereas nondeducibility states that, in a
system, information cannot flow between specified sources and sinks,
BD security indicates upper bounds for the flow and triggers under
which these upper bounds are no longer guaranteed."""

Generalised BD Security from I/O automata to nondeterministic
transition systems, with the former retained as an instance of the
latter (renaming locale BD_Security to BD_Security_IO).
Generalise unwinding conditions to allow making more than one
transition at a time when constructing alternative traces.
Add results about the expressivity of declassification triggers vs.
bounds, due to Thomas Bauereiss (added as author)."""
