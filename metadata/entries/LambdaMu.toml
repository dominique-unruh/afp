The propositions-as-types correspondence is ordinarily presented as
linking the metatheory of typed λ-calculi and the proof theory of
intuitionistic logic. Griffin observed that this correspondence could
be extended to classical logic through the use of control operators.
This observation set off a flurry of further research, leading to the
development of Parigots λμ-calculus. In this work, we formalise λμ-
calculus in Isabelle/HOL and prove several metatheoretical properties
such as type preservation and progress."""
