abstract = """
We bring the labelled sequent calculus $LS_{PASL}$ for propositional
abstract separation logic to Isabelle. The tactics given here are
directly applied on an extension of the Separation Algebra in the AFP.
In addition to the cancellative separation algebra, we further
consider some useful properties in the heap model of separation logic,
such as indivisible unit, disjointness, and cross-split. The tactics
are essentially a proof search procedure for the calculus $LS_{PASL}$.
We wrap the tactics in an Isabelle method called separata, and give a
few examples of separation logic formulae which are provable by
separata."""
