abstract = """
A formalization of the theory of quantum and classical registers as
developed by (Unruh, Quantum and Classical Registers). In a nutshell,
a register refers to a part of a larger memory or system that can be
accessed independently.  Registers can be constructed from other
registers and several (compatible) registers can be composed. This
formalization develops both the generic theory of registers as well as
specific instantiations for classical and quantum registers."""
