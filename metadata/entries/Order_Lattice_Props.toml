abstract = """
These components add further fundamental order and lattice-theoretic
concepts and properties to Isabelle's libraries.  They follow by
and large the introductory sections of the Compendium of Continuous
Lattices,  covering directed and filtered sets, down-closed and
up-closed sets, ideals and filters, Galois connections, closure and
co-closure operators. Some emphasis is on duality and morphisms
between structures, as in the Compendium.  To this end, three ad-hoc
approaches to duality are compared."""
