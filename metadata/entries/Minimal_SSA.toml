<p>This formalization is an extension to <a
href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Formal_SSA.html\">\"Verified
Construction of Static Single Assignment Form\"</a>. In
their work, the authors have shown that <a
href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-37051-9_6\">Braun
et al.'s static single assignment (SSA) construction
algorithm</a> produces minimal SSA form for input programs with
a reducible control flow graph (CFG). However Braun et al. also
proposed an extension to their algorithm that they claim produces
minimal SSA form even for irreducible CFGs.<br> In this
formalization we support that claim by giving a mechanized proof.
</p>
<p>As the extension of Braun et al.'s algorithm
aims for removing so-called redundant strongly connected components of
phi functions, we show that this suffices to guarantee minimality
according to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1145/115372.115320\">Cytron et
al.</a>.</p>"""
