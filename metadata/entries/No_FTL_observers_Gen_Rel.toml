abstract = "We have <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/No_FTL_observers.html\">previously verified</a>, in the first order theory SpecRel of Special Relativity, that inertial observers cannot travel faster than light. We now prove the corresponding result for GenRel, the first-order theory of General Relativity. Specifically, we prove that whenever an observer <i>m</i> encounters another observer <i>k</i> (so that <i>m</i> and <i>k</i> are both present at some spacetime location <i>x</i>), <i>k</i> will necessarily be observed by <i>m</i> to be traveling at less than light speed."
