We formulate classical propositional logic as an axiom class. Our
  class represents a Hilbert-style proof system with the axioms
  \\(\\vdash \\varphi \\to \\psi \\to \\varphi\\),
  \\(\\vdash (\\varphi \\to \\psi \\to \\chi) \\to (\\varphi \\to \\psi) \\to
  \\varphi \\to \\chi\\), and
  \\(\\vdash ((\\varphi \\to \\bot) \\to \\bot) \\to \\varphi\\) along with the
  rule <em>modus ponens</em>
  \\(\\vdash \\varphi \\to \\psi \\Longrightarrow \\; \\vdash \\varphi
  \\Longrightarrow \\; \\vdash \\psi\\). In this axiom class we provide
  lemmas to obtain <em>Maximally Consistent Sets</em> via Zorn's lemma.
  We define the concrete classical propositional calculus inductively
  and show it instantiates our axiom class. We formulate the usual
  semantics for the propositional calculus and show strong soundness
  and completeness. We provide conventional definitions of the other
  logical connectives and prove various common identities. Finally, we
  show that the propositional calculus <em>embeds</em> into any logic in
  our axiom class."""
