We formalise results from computability theory: recursive functions,
undecidability of the halting problem, and the existence of a
universal Turing machine. This formalisation is the AFP entry
corresponding to the paper Mechanising Turing Machines and Computability Theory
in Isabelle/HOL, ITP 2013."""
