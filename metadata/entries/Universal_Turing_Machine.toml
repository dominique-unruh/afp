This entry formalises results from computability theory: recursive functions,
undecidability of the halting problem, and the existence of a
universal Turing machine. This formalisation is the AFP entry
corresponding to the paper Mechanising Turing Machines and Computability Theory
in Isabelle/HOL, ITP 2013. The main book used for this formalisation is
by Boolos, Burgess, and Jeffrey on <i>Computability and Logic</i>.

Joosten contributed mainly by making the files ready for the
AFP.  His need for a formalisation of Turing Machines arose from
realising that the current formalisation of saturation graphs
(also in the AFP) was missing a key undecidability result
present in his paper on <i>Finding models through graph saturation</i>.

Regensburger contributed by adding definitions for
concepts like Turing Decidability, Turing Computability and Turing Reducibility
for problem reduction. He also enhanced the result about the
undecidability of the General Halting Problem given in the original AFP entry
by first proving the undecidability of the Special Halting Problem and then
proving its reducibility to the general problem. The original version of this
AFP entry did only prove a weak form of the undecidability theorem.
The main motivation behind this contribution is to make the AFP entry
accessible for bachelor and master students.
