The <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1561/0400000010\"><i>Method of Conditional Expectations</i></a> (sometimes also called \"Method of Conditional Probabilities\") is one of the prominent
derandomization techniques. Given a randomized algorithm, it allows the construction of a 
deterministic algorithm with a result that matches the average-case quality of the randomized
algorithm.

Using this technique, this entry starts with a simple example, an algorithm that obtains
a cut that crosses at least half of the edges. This is a well-known approximate solution to the 
Max-Cut problem. It is followed by a more complex and interesting result: an algorithm
that returns an independent set matching (or exceeding) the <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-365X(91)90357-8\">Caro-Wei bound</a>: $\\frac{n}{d+1}$ 
where $n$ is the vertex count and $d$ is the average degree of the graph.

Both algorithms are efficient and deterministic, and follow from the derandomization of a probabilistic existence proof."""
