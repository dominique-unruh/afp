abstract = """
This set of theories presents an Isabelle/HOL formalisation of stream processing components introduced
in Focus,
a framework for formal specification and development of interactive systems.
This is an extended and updated version of the formalisation, which was
elaborated within the methodology \"Focus on Isabelle\".
In addition, we also applied the formalisation on three case studies
that cover different application areas: process control (Steam Boiler System),
data transmission (FlexRay communication protocol),
memory and processing components (Automotive-Gateway System)."""
