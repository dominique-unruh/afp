Research in information-flow security aims at developing methods to
identify undesired information leaks within programs from private
(high) sources to public (low) sinks. For a concurrent system, it is
desirable to have compositional analysis methods that allow for
analyzing each thread independently and that nevertheless guarantee
that the parallel composition of successfully analyzed threads
satisfies a global security guarantee. However, such a compositional
analysis should not be overly pessimistic about what an environment
might do with shared resources. Otherwise, the analysis will reject
many intuitively secure programs.
<p>
The paper \"Assumptions and Guarantees for Compositional
Noninterference\" by Mantel et. al. presents one solution for this problem:
an approach for compositionally reasoning about non-interference in
concurrent programs via rely-guarantee-style reasoning.  We present an
Isabelle/HOL formalization of the concepts and proofs of this approach."""
