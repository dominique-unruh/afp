abstract = """
We give a formalization of affine forms as abstract representations of zonotopes.
We provide affine operations as well as overapproximations of some non-affine operations like multiplication and division.
Expressions involving those operations can automatically be turned into (executable) functions approximating the original
expression in affine arithmetic."""
