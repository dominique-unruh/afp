<p>This entry contains proofs for the textbook results about the
distributions of the height and internal path length of random binary
search trees (BSTs), i.&thinsp;e. BSTs that are formed by taking
an empty BST and inserting elements from a fixed set in random
order.</p>  <p>In particular, we prove a logarithmic upper
bound on the expected height and the <em>Î˜(n log n)</em>
closed-form solution for the expected internal path length in terms of
the harmonic numbers. We also show how the internal path length
relates to the average-case cost of a lookup in a BST.</p>"""
