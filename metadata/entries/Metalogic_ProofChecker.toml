abstract = """
In this entry we formalize Isabelle's metalogic in Isabelle/HOL.
Furthermore, we define a language of proof terms and an executable
proof checker and prove its soundness wrt. the metalogic.  The
formalization is intentionally kept close to the Isabelle
implementation(for example using de Brujin indices) to enable easy
integration of generated code with the Isabelle system without a
complicated translation layer.  The formalization is described in our
<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12224.pdf\">CADE 28 paper</a>."""
