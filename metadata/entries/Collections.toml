abstract = "This development provides an efficient, extensible, machine checked collections framework. The library adopts the concepts of interface, implementation and generic algorithm from object-oriented programming and implements them in Isabelle/HOL. The framework features the use of data refinement techniques to refine an abstract specification (using high-level concepts like sets) to a more concrete implementation (using collection datastructures, like red-black-trees). The code-generator of Isabelle/HOL can be used to generate efficient code."

New Interfaces: OrderedSet, OrderedMap, List.
Fifo now implements list-interface: Function names changed: put/get --> enqueue/dequeue.
New Implementations: ArrayList, ArrayHashMap, ArrayHashSet, TrieMap, TrieSet.
Invariant-free datastructures: Invariant implicitely hidden in typedef.
Record-interfaces: All operations of an interface encapsulated as record.
Examples moved to examples subdirectory.<br>
