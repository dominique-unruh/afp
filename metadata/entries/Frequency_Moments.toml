abstract = """
In 1999 Alon et. al. introduced the still active research topic of
approximating the frequency moments of a data stream using randomized
algorithms with minimal space usage. This includes the problem of
estimating the cardinality of the stream elements - the zeroth
frequency moment. But, also higher-order frequency moments that
provide information about the skew of the data stream. (The
<i>k</i>-th frequency moment of a data stream is the sum
of the <i>k</i>-th powers of the occurrence counts of each
element in the stream.) This entry formalizes three randomized
algorithms for the approximation of
<i>F<sub>0</sub></i>,
<i>F<sub>2</sub></i> and
<i>F<sub>k</sub></i> for <i>k â‰¥
3</i> based on [<a

<a

and verifies their expected accuracy, success probability and space
usage."""
