abstract = """
We introduce OpSets, an executable framework for specifying and
reasoning about the semantics of replicated datatypes that provide
eventual consistency in a distributed system, and for mechanically
verifying algorithms that implement these datatypes. Our approach is
simple but expressive, allowing us to succinctly specify a variety of
abstract datatypes, including maps, sets, lists, text, graphs, trees,
and registers. Our datatypes are also composable, enabling the
construction of complex data structures. To demonstrate the utility of
OpSets for analysing replication algorithms, we highlight an important
correctness property for collaborative text editing that has
traditionally been overlooked; algorithms that do not satisfy this
property can exhibit awkward interleaving of text. We use OpSets to
specify this correctness property and prove that although one existing
replication algorithm satisfies this property, several other published
algorithms do not."""
