This is a formalization of the article <i>Knight's Tour Revisited</i> by
Cull and De Curtins where they prove the existence of a Knight's
path for arbitrary <i>n &times; m</i>-boards with <i>min(n,m) &ge;
5</i>. If <i>n &middot; m</i> is even, then there exists a Knight's
circuit.  A Knight's Path is a sequence of moves of a Knight on a
chessboard s.t. the Knight visits every square of a chessboard
exactly once.  Finding a Knight's path is a an instance of the
Hamiltonian path problem. A Knight's circuit is a Knight's path,
where additionally the Knight can move from the last square to the
first square of the path, forming a loop.  During the formalization
two mistakes in the original proof were discovered. These mistakes
are corrected in this formalization."""
