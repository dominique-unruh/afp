We present a formalization of Markov Decision Processes with rewards.
In particular we first build on HÃ¶lzl's formalization  of MDPs
(AFP entry: Markov_Models) and extend them with rewards. We proceed
with an analysis of the expected total discounted reward criterion for
infinite horizon MDPs. The central result is the construction of the
iteration rule for the Bellman operator. We prove the optimality
equations for this operator and show the existence of an optimal
stationary deterministic solution. The analysis can be used to obtain
dynamic programming algorithms such as value iteration and policy
iteration to solve MDPs with formal guarantees. Our formalization is
based on chapters 5 and 6 in Puterman's book \"Markov
Decision Processes: Discrete Stochastic Dynamic Programming\"."""
