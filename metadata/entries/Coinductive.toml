abstract = "This article collects formalisations of general-purpose coinductive data types and sets. Currently, it contains coinductive natural numbers, coinductive lists, i.e. lazy lists or streams, infinite streams, coinductive terminated lists, coinductive resumptions, a library of operations on coinductive lists, and a version of KÃ¶nig's lemma as an application for coinductive lists.<br>The initial theory was contributed by Paulson and Wenzel. Extensions and other coinductive formalisations of general interest are welcome."
