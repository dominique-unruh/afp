<p>
This entry presents a framework for the modular verification of
DFS-based algorithms, which is described in our [CPP-2015] paper. It
provides a generic DFS algorithm framework, that can be parameterized
with user-defined actions on certain events (e.g. discovery of new
node).  It comes with an extensible library of invariants, which can
be used to derive invariants of a specific parameterization.  Using
refinement techniques, efficient implementations of the algorithms can
easily be derived. Here, the framework comes with templates for a
recursive and a tail-recursive implementation, and also with several
templates for implementing the data structures required by the DFS
algorithm.  Finally, this entry contains a set of re-usable DFS-based
algorithms, which illustrate the application of the framework.
