<p>This entry provides proofs for two important congruences involving Bernoulli numbers.
The proofs follow Cohen's textbook <em>Number Theory Volume II: Analytic and Modern Tools</em>.
In the following we write $\\mathcal{B}_k = N_k / D_k$ for the $k$-th Bernoulli number (with $\\text{gcd}(N_k, D_k) = 1$).
</p>
<p>
The first result that I showed is <em>Voronoi's congruence</em>, which states that for any even integer
$k\\geq 2$ and all positive coprime integers $a$, $n$ we have:</p>
$$(a^k - 1) N_k \\equiv k a^{k-1} D_k \\sum_{m=1}^{n-1} m^{k-1} \\left\\lfloor\\frac{ma}{n}\\right\\rfloor
\\hspace{3mm}(\\text{mod}\\ n)$$
<p>
Building upon this, I then derive <em>Kummer's congruence</em>. In its common form, it states that 
for a prime $p$ and even integers $k,k'$ with $\\text{min}(k,k')\\geq e+1$ and $(p - 1) \\nmid k$ and
$k \\equiv k'\\ (\\text{mod}\\ \\varphi(p^e))$, we have:</p>
$$\\frac{\\mathcal{B}_k}{k} \\equiv \\frac{\\mathcal{B}_{k'}}{k'}\\hspace{3mm}(\\text{mod}\\ p^e)$$
<p>The version proved in my entry is slightly more general than this.</p>
<p>
One application of these congruences is to prove that there are infinitely many irregular primes,
which I formalised as well.</p>"""
