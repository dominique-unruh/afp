We formalize a range of proof systems for classical propositional
logic (sequent calculus, natural deduction, Hilbert systems,
resolution) and prove the most important meta-theoretic results about
semantics and proofs: compactness, soundness, completeness,
translations between proof systems, cut-elimination, interpolation and
model existence."""
