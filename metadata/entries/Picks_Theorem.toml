abstract = "We formalize Pick's theorem for finding the area of a simple polygon whose vertices are integral lattice points. We are inspired by John Harrison's formalization of Pick's theorem in HOL Light, but tailor our proof approach to avoid a primary challenge point in his formalization, which is proving that any polygon with more than three vertices can be split (in its interior) by a line between some two vertices. Our formalization involves augmenting the existing geometry libraries in various foundational ways (e.g., by adding the definition of a polygon and formalizing some key properties thereof)."
