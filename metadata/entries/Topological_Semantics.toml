abstract = """
We introduce a generalized topological semantics for paraconsistent
and paracomplete logics by drawing upon early works on topological
Boolean algebras (cf. works by Kuratowski, Zarycki, McKinsey &
Tarski, etc.). In particular, this work exemplarily illustrates the
shallow semantical embeddings approach (<a
href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11787-012-0052-y\">SSE</a>)
employing the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL. By means of the SSE
technique we can effectively harness theorem provers, model finders
and 'hammers' for reasoning with quantified non-classical
logics."""
