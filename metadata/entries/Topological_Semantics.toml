We investigate mathematical structures that provide natural semantics for families of (quantified) non-classical logics featuring special unary connectives, known as recovery operators, that allow us to 'recover' the properties of classical logic in a controlled manner. These structures are known as topological Boolean algebras, which are Boolean algebras extended with additional operations subject to specific conditions of a topological nature. In this study we focus on the paradigmatic case of negation. We demonstrate how these algebras are well-suited to provide a semantics for some families of paraconsistent Logics of Formal Inconsistency and paracomplete Logics of Formal Undeterminedness. These logics feature recovery operators used to earmark propositions that behave 'classically' when interacting with non-classical negations.
We refer to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04284">companion paper</a> for more information.
