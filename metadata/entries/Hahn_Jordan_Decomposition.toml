In this work we formalize the Hahn decomposition theorem for signed
measures, namely that any measure space for a signed measure can be
decomposed into a positive and a negative set, where every measurable
subset of the positive one has a positive measure, and every
measurable subset of the negative one has a negative measure. We also
formalize the Jordan decomposition theorem as a corollary, which
states that the signed measure under consideration admits a unique
decomposition into a difference of two positive measures, at least one
of which is finite."""
