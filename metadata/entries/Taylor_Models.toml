abstract = """
We present a formally verified implementation of multivariate Taylor
models. Taylor models are a form of rigorous polynomial approximation,
consisting of an approximation polynomial based on Taylor expansions,
combined with a rigorous bound on the approximation error. Taylor
models were introduced as a tool to mitigate the dependency problem of
interval arithmetic. Our implementation automatically computes Taylor
models for the class of elementary functions, expressed by composition
of arithmetic operations and basic functions like exp, sin, or square
root."""
