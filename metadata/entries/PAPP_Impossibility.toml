<p>
  In party-approval multi-winner elections, the goal is to allocate the seats of a fixed-size
  committee to parties based on approval ballots of the voters over the parties. In particular, each
  can approve multiple parties and each party can be assigned multiple seats.
</p>

<p>Three central requirements in this settings are:</p>
<dl style=\"margin-left: 1em;\">
  <dt style=\"float:left; margin-right: 0.3em; font-weight: bold;\">Anonymity:</dt>
  <dd style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5em\">The result is invariant under renaming the voters.</dd>
  <dt style=\"clear:both; float:left; margin-right: 0.3em; font-weight: bold;\">Representation:</dt>
  <dd style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5em\">Every sufficiently large group of voters with similar preferences
    is represented by some committee members.
  </dd>
  <dt style=\"clear:both; float:left; margin-right: 0.3em; font-weight: bold;\">Strategy-proofness:
  </dt>
  <dd>No voter can benefit by misreporting her true preferences.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
  We show that these three basic axioms are incompatible for party-approval multi-winner voting
  rules,
  thus proving a far-reaching impossibility theorem.</p>
<p>The proof of this result is obtained by
  formulating the problem in propositional logic and then letting a SAT solver show that the
  formula is unsatisfiable. The DRUP proof output by the SAT solver is then converted into
  <a href=\"https://www21.in.tum.de/~lammich/grat/\">Lammich's GRAT format</a> and imported into
  Isabelle/HOL with some custom-written ML code.</p>
<p>This transformation is proof-producing, so the final Isabelle/HOL theorem does not rely on any
  oracles
  or other trusted external trusted components.</p>"""
