abstract = """
This library defines three different versions of pairing heaps: a
functional version of the original design based on binary
trees [Fredman et al. 1986], the version by Okasaki [1998] and
a modified version of the latter that is free of structural invariants.
<p>
The amortized complexity of pairing heaps is analyzed in the AFP article
<a href=\"http://isa-afp.org/entries/Amortized_Complexity.html\">Amortized Complexity</a>."""
