abstract = """
<p>This work contains a proof that Euler's number e is transcendental. The
proof follows the standard approach of assuming that e is algebraic and
then using a specific integer polynomial to derive two inconsistent bounds,
leading to a contradiction.</p> <p>This kind of approach can be found in
many different sources; this formalisation mostly follows a <a  href=\"http://planetmath.org/proofoflindemannweierstrasstheoremandthateandpiaretranscendental\">PlanetMath article</a> by Roger Lipsett.</p>"""
