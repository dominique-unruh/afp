This Isabelle/HOL formalization builds on the
<em>VeriComp</em> entry of the <em>Archive of Formal
Proofs</em> to provide the following contributions:  <ul>
<li>an operational semantics for a realistic virtual machine
(Std) for dynamically typed programming languages;</li>
<li>the formalization of an inline caching optimization (Inca),
a proof of bisimulation with (Std), and a compilation
function;</li> <li>the formalization of an unboxing
optimization (Ubx), a proof of bisimulation with (Inca), and a simple
compilation function.</li> </ul>  This formalization was
described in the CPP 2021 paper <em>Towards Efficient and
Verified Virtual Machines for Dynamic Languages</em>"""
