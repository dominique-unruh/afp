abstract = """
We provide a formalization of a variant of the superposition
calculus, together with formal proofs of soundness and refutational
completeness (w.r.t. the usual redundancy criteria based on clause
ordering). This version of the calculus uses all the standard
restrictions of the superposition rules, together with the following
refinement, inspired by the basic superposition calculus: each clause
is associated with a set of terms which are assumed to be in normal
form -- thus any application of the replacement rule on these terms is
blocked. The set is initially empty and terms may be added or removed
at each inference step. The set of terms that are assumed to be in
normal form includes any term introduced by previous unifiers as well
as any term occurring in the parent clauses at a position that is
smaller (according to some given ordering on positions) than a
previously replaced term. The standard superposition calculus
corresponds to the case where the set of irreducible terms is always
empty."""
