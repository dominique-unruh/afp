We provide our Isabelle/HOL formalization of a Conflict-free
Replicated Datatype for Internet Message Access Protocol commands.
We show that Strong Eventual Consistency (SEC) is guaranteed
by proving the commutativity of concurrent operations. We base our
formalization on the recently proposed \"framework for
establishing Strong Eventual Consistency for Conflict-free Replicated
Datatypes\" (AFP.CRDT) from Gomes et al. Hence, we provide an
additional example of how the recently proposed framework can be used
to design and prove CRDTs."""
