abstract = """
We present an Isabelle/HOL formalization and total correctness proof
for the incremental version of the Simplex algorithm which is used in
most state-of-the-art SMT solvers. It supports extraction of
satisfying assignments, extraction of minimal unsatisfiable cores, incremental
assertion of constraints and backtracking. The formalization relies on
stepwise program refinement, starting from a simple specification,
going through a number of refinement steps, and ending up in a fully
executable functional implementation. Symmetries present in the
algorithm are handled with special care."""
