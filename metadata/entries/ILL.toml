abstract = "In this entry we formalise intuitionistic linear logic (ILL) with a deep embedding of propositions, and shallow and deep embeddings of deductions. We introduce the logic with an <i>explicit</i> exchange rule, meaning sequents have a list of propositions as antecedents. We then prove that sequents that differ only in the order of their antecedents are equivalently valid, representing the alternative <i>implicit</i> exchange rule. The deep embedding of deductions allows for direct construction, manipulation and verification of ILL deductions."
