<p>This article gives a formal version of Furstenberg's
topological proof of the infinitude of primes. He defines a topology
on the integers based on arithmetic progressions (or, equivalently,
residue classes). Using some fairly obvious properties of this
topology, the infinitude of primes is then easily obtained.</p>
<p>Apart from this, this topology is also fairly ‘nice’ in
general: it is second countable, metrizable, and perfect. All of these
(well-known) facts are formally proven, including an explicit metric
for the topology given by Zulfeqarr.</p>"""
