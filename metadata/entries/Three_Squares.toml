We formalize the Legendre's three squares theorem and its consequences,
in particular the following results:
<ol>
    <li>
        A natural number can be represented as the sum of
        three squares of natural numbers if and only if it is not
        of the form $4^a (8 k + 7)$, where $a$ and $k$ are natural numbers.
    </li>
    <li>
        If $n$ is a natural number such that $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{8}$,
        then $n$ can be be represented as the sum of three squares
        of odd natural numbers.
    </li>
</ol>

Consequences include the following:
<ol>
    <li>
        An integer $n$ can be written as $n = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + z$,
        where $x$, $y$, $z$ are integers, if and only if $n \\geq 0$.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Legendre's four squares theorem: any natural number
        can be represented as the sum of four squares of natural numbers.
    </li>
</ol>"""
