abstract = "This entry verifies a number of worklist algorithms for exploring sets of reachable sets of transition systems with subsumption relations. Informally speaking, a node $a$ is subsumed by a node $b$ if everything that is reachable from $a$ is also reachable from $b$. Starting from a general abstract view of transition systems, we gradually add structure while refining our algorithms to more efficient versions. In the end, we obtain efficient imperative algorithms, which operate on a shared data structure to keep track of explored and yet-to-be-explored states, similar to the algorithms used in timed automata model checking [2, 1]. This entry forms part of the work described in a paper by the authors of this entry [4] and a PhD thesis [3]."
