<p>
A <em>matching</em> in a graph <i>G</i> is a subset <i>M</i> of the
edges of <i>G</i> such that no two share an endpoint. A matching has maximum
cardinality if its cardinality is at least as large as that of any other
matching. An <em>odd-set cover</em> <i>OSC</i> of a graph <i>G</i> is a
labeling of the nodes of <i>G</i> with integers such that every edge of
<i>G</i> is either incident to a node labeled 1 or connects two nodes
labeled with the same number <i>i &ge; 2</i>.
</p><p>
This article proves Edmonds theorem:<br>
Let <i>M</i> be a matching in a graph <i>G</i> and let <i>OSC</i> be an
odd-set cover of <i>G</i>.
For any <i>i &ge; 0</i>, let <var>n(i)</var> be the number of nodes
labeled <i>i</i>. If <i>|M| = n(1) +
&sum;<sub>i &ge; 2</sub>(n(i) div 2)</i>,
then <i>M</i> is a maximum cardinality matching.
