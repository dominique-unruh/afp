We present an Isabelle formalization of abstract rewriting (see, e.g.,
the book by Baader and Nipkow). First, we define standard relations like
<i>joinability</i>, <i>meetability</i>, <i>conversion</i>, etc. Then, we
formalize important properties of abstract rewrite systems, e.g.,
confluence and strong normalization. Our main concern is on strong
normalization, since this formalization is the basis of <a
href=\"http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/software/ceta\">CeTA</a> (which is
mainly about strong normalization of term rewrite systems). Hence lemmas
involving strong normalization constitute by far the biggest part of this
theory. One of those is Newman's lemma."""
