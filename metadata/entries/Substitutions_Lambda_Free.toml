abstract = """
This theory provides a formalization of substitutions on \\(\\lambda\\)-free higher-order terms, establishing a structured framework with the expected algebraic properties. It introduces a type construction for the rigorous definition and manipulation of substitutions.
The main theorem of this theory proves the existence of fixed-point substitutions under acyclicity, a theorem that is too often regarded as trivial in the literature."""
