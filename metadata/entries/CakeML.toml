CakeML is a functional programming language with a proven-correct
compiler and runtime system. This entry contains an unofficial version
of the CakeML semantics that has been exported from the Lem
specifications to Isabelle. Additionally, there are some hand-written
theory files that adapt the exported code to Isabelle and port proofs
from the HOL4 formalization, e.g. termination and equivalence proofs."""
