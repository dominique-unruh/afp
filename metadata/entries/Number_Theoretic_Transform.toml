<p>This entry contains an Isabelle formalization of the
<em>Number Theoretic Transform (NTT)</em> which is the
analogue to a <em>Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)</em>
over a finite field. Roots of unity in the complex numbers are
replaced by those in a finite field. </p><p>First, we
define both <em>NTT</em> and the inverse transform
<em>INTT</em> in Isabelle and prove them to be mutually
inverse. </p><p><em>DFT</em> can be
efficiently computed by the recursive <em>Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT)</em>. In our formalization, this algorithm is adapted to
the setting of the <em>NTT</em>: We implement a
<em>Fast Number Theoretic Transform (FNTT)</em> based on
the Butterfly scheme by Cooley and Tukey. Additionally, we provide an
inverse transform <em>IFNTT</em> and prove it mutually
inverse to <em>FNTT</em>. </p><p> Afterwards,
a recursive formalization of the <em>FNTT</em> running
time is examined and the famous $O(n \\log n)$ bounds
are proven.</p>"""
