This entry contains the confidentiality verification of the
(functional kernel of) the CoSMeDis  distributed social media platform
presented in [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1109/SP.2017.24\">1</a>].
CoSMeDis is a multi-node extension the CoSMed prototype social media
platform [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-43144-4_6\">2</a>,

<a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/CoSMed.html\">4</a>].
The confidentiality properties are formalized as instances of BD
Security [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ITP.2021.3\">5</a>,
<a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Bounded_Deducibility_Security.html\">6</a>].
The lifting of confidentiality properties from single nodes to the
entire CoSMeDis network is performed using compositionality and
transport theorems for BD Security, which are described in [<a
href=\"https://doi.org/10.1109/SP.2017.24\">1</a>]
and formalized in a separate <a
