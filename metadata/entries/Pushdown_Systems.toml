We formalize pushdown systems and the correctness of the pushdown reachability algorithms post* (forward search), pre* (backward search) and dual* (bi-directional search). For pre* we refine the algorithm to an executable version for which one can generate code using Isabelle's code generator. For pre* and post* we follow Stefan Schwoon's PhD thesis [Sch02a]. The dual* algorithm is from a paper by Jensen et. al presented at ATVA2021 [JSS+21]. The formalization is described in our FMCAD2022 paper [SSST22] in which we also document how we have used it to do differential testing against a C++ implementation of pushdown reachability called PDAAAL. Lammich et al. [Lam09, LMW09] formalized the pre* algorithm for dynamic pushdown networks (DPN) which is a generalization of pushdown systems. Our work is independent from that because the post* of DPNs is not regular and additionally the DPN formalization does not support epsilon transitions which we use for post* and dual*.
