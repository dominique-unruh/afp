abstract = """
We represent a theory <i>of</i> (a fragment of) Isabelle/HOL <i>in</i>
Isabelle/HOL. The purpose of this exercise is to write packages for
domain-specific specifications such as class models, B-machines, ...,
and generally speaking, any domain-specific languages whose
abstract syntax can be defined by a HOL \"datatype\". On this basis, the
Isabelle code-generator can then be used to generate code for global
context transformations as well as tactic code.
<p>
Consequently the package is geared towards
parsing, printing and code-generation to the Isabelle API.
It is at the moment not sufficiently rich for doing meta theory on
Isabelle itself. Extensions in this direction are possible though.
<p>
Moreover, the chosen fragment is fairly rudimentary. However it should be
easily adapted to one's needs if a package is written on top of it.
The supported API contains types, terms, transformation of
global context like definitions and data-type declarations as well
as infrastructure for Isar-setups.
<p>
This theory is drawn from the
<a href=\"http://isa-afp.org/entries/Featherweight_OCL.html\">Featherweight OCL</a>
project where
it is used to construct a package for object-oriented data-type theories
generated from UML class diagrams. The Featherweight OCL, for example, allows for
both the direct execution of compiled tactic code by the Isabelle API
as well as the generation of \".thy\"-files for debugging purposes.
<p>
Gained experience from this project shows that the compiled code is sufficiently
efficient for practical purposes while being based on a formal <i>model</i>
on which properties of the package can be proven such as termination of certain
transformations, correctness, etc."""
