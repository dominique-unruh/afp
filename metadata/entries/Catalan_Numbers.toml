<p>In this work, we define the Catalan numbers $C_n$
and prove several equivalent definitions (including some closed-form
formulae). We also show one of their applications (counting the number
of binary trees of size $n$), prove the asymptotic growth
approximation $C_n \\sim \\frac{4^n}{\\sqrt{\\pi}\\, n^{3/2}}$, and provide reasonably efficient executable
code to compute them.</p>  <p>The derivation of the closed-form
formulae uses algebraic manipulations of the ordinary generating
function of the Catalan numbers, and the asymptotic approximation is
then done using generalised binomial coefficients and the Gamma
function.</p>"""
