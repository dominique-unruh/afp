<p>In this work, we define the Catalan numbers <em>C<sub>n</sub></em>
and prove several equivalent definitions (including some closed-form
formulae). We also show one of their applications (counting the number
of binary trees of size <em>n</em>), prove the asymptotic growth
approximation <em>C<sub>n</sub> &sim; 4<sup>n</sup> / (&radic;<span
style=\"text-decoration: overline\">&pi;</span> &middot;
n<sup>1.5</sup>)</em>, and provide reasonably efficient executable
code to compute them.</p>  <p>The derivation of the closed-form
formulae uses algebraic manipulations of the ordinary generating
function of the Catalan numbers, and the asymptotic approximation is
then done using generalised binomial coefficients and the Gamma
function. Thanks to these highly non-elementary mathematical tools,
the proofs are very short and simple.</p>"""
