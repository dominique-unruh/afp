Graph lemma quantifies the defect effect of a system of word
equations. That is, it provides an upper bound on the rank of the
system. We formalize the proof based on the decomposition of a
solution into its free basis. A direct application is an alternative
proof of the fact that two noncommuting words form a code."""
