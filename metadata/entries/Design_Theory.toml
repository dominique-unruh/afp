abstract = """
Combinatorial design theory studies incidence set systems with certain
balance and symmetry properties. It is closely related to hypergraph
theory. This formalisation presents a general library for formal
reasoning on incidence set systems, designs and their applications,
including formal definitions and proofs for many key properties,
operations, and theorems on the construction and existence of designs.
Notably, this includes formalising t-designs, balanced incomplete
block designs (BIBD), group divisible designs (GDD), pairwise balanced
designs (PBD), design isomorphisms, and the relationship between
graphs and designs. A locale-centric approach has been used to manage
the relationships between the many different types of designs.
Theorems of particular interest include the necessary conditions for
existence of a BIBD, Wilson's construction on GDDs, and
Bose's inequality on resolvable designs. Parts of this
formalisation are explored in the paper \"A Modular First
Formalisation of Combinatorial Design Theory\", presented at CICM 2021."""
