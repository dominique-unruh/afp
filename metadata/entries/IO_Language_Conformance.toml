abstract = """
This entry formalises the paper of the same name by Huang et al. and presents a unifying characterisation of well-known conformance relations such as equivalence and language inclusion (reduction) on languages over input/output pairs.
This characterisation simplifies comparisons between conformance relations and from it a fundamental necessary and sufficient criterion for conformance testing is developed."""
