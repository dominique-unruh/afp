abstract = """
Worst-case optimal multiway-join algorithms are recent seminal
achievement of the database community. These algorithms compute the
natural join of multiple relational databases and improve in the worst
case over traditional query plan optimizations of nested binary joins.
In 2014, <a
href=\"https://doi.org/10.1145/2590989.2590991\">Ngo, RÃ©,
and Rudra</a> gave a unified presentation of different multi-way
join algorithms. We formalized and proved correct their \"Generic
Join\" algorithm and extended it to support negative joins."""
