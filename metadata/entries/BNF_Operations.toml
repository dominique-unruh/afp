This entry formalizes the closure property of bounded natural functors
(BNFs) under seven operations. These operations and the corresponding
proofs constitute the core of Isabelle's (co)datatype package. To
be close to the implemented tactics, the proofs are deliberately
formulated as detailed apply scripts. The (co)datatypes together with
(co)induction principles and (co)recursors are byproducts of the
fixpoint operations LFP and GFP. Composition of BNFs is subdivided
into four simpler operations: Compose, Kill, Lift, and Permute. The
N2M operation provides mutual (co)induction principles and
(co)recursors for nested (co)datatypes."""
