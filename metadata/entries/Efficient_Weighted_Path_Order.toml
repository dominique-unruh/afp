abstract = """
<p>The Weighted Path Order (WPO) of Yamada is a powerful technique for proving
termination. In a previous AFP entry, the WPO was defined and properties of WPO
have been formally verified. However, the implementation of WPO was naive,
leading to an exponential runtime in the worst case.
</p><p>
Therefore, in this AFP entry we provide a poly-time implementation of WPO. The
implementation is based on memoization. Since WPO generalizes the recursive path
order (RPO), we also easily derive an efficient implementation of RPO.
