This work formalizes Zeckendorf's theorem. The theorem states that every positive integer can be uniquely represented as a sum of one or more non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers. More precisely, if $N$ is a positive integer, there exist unique positive integers $c_i \\ge 2$ with $c_{i+1} > c_i + 1$, such that 
\\[
   N = \\sum_{i=0}^k F_{c_i} 
\\]
where $F_n$ is the $n$-th Fibonacci number."""
