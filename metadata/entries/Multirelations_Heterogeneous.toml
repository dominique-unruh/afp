abstract = "Binary multirelations form a model of alternating nondeterminism useful for analysing games, interactions of computing systems with their environments or abstract interpretations of probabilistic programs. We investigate this alternating structure in a relational language based on power allegories extended with specific operations on multirelations. We develop algebras of modal operators over multirelations, related to concurrent dynamic logics, in this language."
