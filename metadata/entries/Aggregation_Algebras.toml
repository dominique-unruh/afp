abstract = """
We develop algebras for aggregation and minimisation for weight
matrices and for edge weights in graphs. We verify the correctness of
Prim's and Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithms based
on these algebras. We also show numerous instances of these algebras
based on linearly ordered commutative semigroups."""
