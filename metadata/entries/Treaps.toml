abstract = """
<p> A Treap is a binary tree whose nodes contain pairs
consisting of some payload and an associated priority. It must have
the search-tree property w.r.t. the payloads and the heap property
w.r.t. the priorities. Treaps are an interesting data structure that
is related to binary search trees (BSTs) in the following way: if one
forgets all the priorities of a treap, the resulting BST is exactly
the same as if one had inserted the elements into an empty BST in
order of ascending priority. This means that a treap behaves like a
BST where we can pretend the elements were inserted in a different
order from the one in which they were actually inserted. </p>
<p> In particular, by choosing these priorities at random upon
insertion of an element, we can pretend that we inserted the elements
in <em>random order</em>, so that the shape of the
resulting tree is that of a random BST no matter in what order we
insert the elements. This is the main result of this
formalisation.</p>"""
