abstract = """
This article deals with the formalisation of some group-theoretic
results including the fundamental theorem of finitely generated
abelian groups characterising the structure of these groups as a
uniquely determined product of cyclic groups. Both the invariant
factor decomposition and the primary decomposition are covered.
Additional work includes results about the direct product, the
internal direct product and more group-theoretic lemmas."""
