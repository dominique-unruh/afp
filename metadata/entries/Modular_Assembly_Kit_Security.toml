abstract = """
The \"Modular Assembly Kit for Security Properties\" (MAKS) is
a framework for both the definition and verification of possibilistic
information-flow security properties at the specification-level. MAKS
supports the uniform representation of a wide range of possibilistic
information-flow properties and provides support for the verification
of such properties via unwinding results and compositionality results.
We provide a formalization of this framework in Isabelle/HOL."""
