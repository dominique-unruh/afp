<p>The Euler-MacLaurin formula relates the value of a
discrete sum to that of the corresponding integral in terms of the
derivatives at the borders of the summation and a remainder term.
Since the remainder term is often very small as the summation bounds
grow, this can be used to compute asymptotic expansions for
sums.</p>  <p>This entry contains a proof of this formula
for functions from the reals to an arbitrary Banach space. Two
variants of the formula are given: the standard textbook version and a
variant outlined in <em>Concrete Mathematics</em> that is
more useful for deriving asymptotic estimates.</p>  <p>As
example applications, we use that formula to derive the full
asymptotic expansion of the harmonic numbers and the sum of inverse
squares.</p>"""
