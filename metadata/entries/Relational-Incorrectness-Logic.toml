abstract = """
Recently, authors have proposed under-approximate logics for reasoning
about programs. So far, all such logics have been confined to
reasoning about individual program behaviours. Yet there exist many
over-approximate relational logics for reasoning about pairs of
programs and relating their behaviours. We present the first
under-approximate relational logic, for the simple imperative language
IMP. We prove our logic is both sound and complete. Additionally, we
show how reasoning in this logic can be decomposed into non-relational
reasoning in an under-approximate Hoare logic, mirroring Beringerâ€™s
result for over-approximate relational logics. We illustrate the
application of our logic on some small examples in which we provably
demonstrate the presence of insecurity."""
