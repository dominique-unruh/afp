abstract = """
Inspired by Abstract Cryptography, we extend CryptHOL, a framework for
formalizing game-based proofs, with an abstract model of Random
Systems and provide proof rules about their composition and equality.
This foundation facilitates the formalization of Constructive
Cryptography proofs, where the security of a cryptographic scheme is
realized as a special form of construction in which a complex random
system is built from simpler ones. This is a first step towards a
fully-featured compositional framework, similar to Universal
Composability framework, that supports formalization of
simulation-based proofs."""
