This article formalizes the specification and the algorithm of the
cryptographic scheme CRYSTALS-KYBER with multiplication using the
Number Theoretic Transform and verifies its (1-δ)-correctness proof.
CRYSTALS-KYBER is a key encapsulation mechanism in lattice-based
post-quantum cryptography.  This entry formalizes the key generation,
encryption and decryption algorithms and shows that the algorithm
decodes correctly under a highly probable assumption
((1-δ)-correctness). Moreover, the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) in
the case of Kyber and the convolution theorem thereon is formalized."""
