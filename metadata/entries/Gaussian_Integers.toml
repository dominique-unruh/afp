abstract = """
<p>The Gaussian integers are the subring &#8484;[i] of the
complex numbers, i. e. the ring of all complex numbers with integral
real and imaginary part. This article provides a definition of this
ring as well as proofs of various basic properties, such as that they
form a Euclidean ring and a full classification of their primes. An
executable (albeit not very efficient) factorisation algorithm is also
provided.</p> <p>Lastly, this Gaussian integer
formalisation is used in two short applications:</p> <ol>
<li> The characterisation of all positive integers that can be
written as sums of two squares</li> <li> Euclid's
formula for primitive Pythagorean triples</li> </ol>
<p>While elementary proofs for both of these are already
available in the AFP, the theory of Gaussian integers provides more
concise proofs and a more high-level view.</p>"""
