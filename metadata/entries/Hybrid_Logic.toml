This work is a formalization of soundness and completeness proofs
for a Seligman-style tableau system for hybrid logic. The completeness
result is obtained via a synthetic approach using maximally
consistent sets of tableau blocks. The formalization differs from
previous work in a few ways. First, to avoid the need to backtrack in
the construction of a tableau, the formalized system has no unnamed
initial segment, and therefore no Name rule. Second, I show that the
full Bridge rule is admissible in the system. Third, I start from rules
restricted to only extend the branch with new formulas, including only
witnessing diamonds that are not already witnessed, and show that
the unrestricted rules are admissible. Similarly, I start from simpler
versions of the @-rules and show that these are sufficient.
The GoTo rule is restricted using a notion of potential such that each
application consumes potential and potential is earned through applications of
the remaining rules. I show that if a branch can be closed then it can
be closed starting from a single unit. Finally, Nom is restricted by
a fixed set of allowed nominals. The resulting system should be terminating."""
