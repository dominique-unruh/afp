This work is a formalization of soundness and completeness of the Bernays-Tarski
axiom system for classical implicational logic. The completeness proof is
constructive following the approach by László Kalmár, Elliott Mendelson and
others. The result can be extended to full classical propositional logic by
uncommenting a few lines for falsehood.
