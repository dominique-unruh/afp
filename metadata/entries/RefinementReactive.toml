abstract = """
We present a formalization of refinement calculus for reactive systems.
Refinement calculus is based on monotonic predicate transformers
(monotonic functions from sets of post-states to sets of pre-states),
and it is a powerful formalism for reasoning about imperative programs.
We model reactive systems as monotonic property transformers
that transform sets of output infinite sequences into sets of input
infinite sequences. Within this semantics we can model
refinement of reactive systems, (unbounded) angelic and
demonic nondeterminism, sequential composition, and
other semantic properties. We can model systems that may
fail for some inputs, and we can model compatibility of systems.
We can specify systems that have liveness properties using
linear temporal logic, and we can refine system specifications
into systems based on symbolic transitions systems, suitable
for implementations."""
