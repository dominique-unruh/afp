abstract = """
We implement and prove correct Dijkstra's algorithm for the
single source shortest path problem, conceived in 1956 by E. Dijkstra.
The algorithm is implemented using the data refinement framework for monadic,
nondeterministic programs. An efficient implementation is derived using data
structures from the Isabelle Collection Framework."""
