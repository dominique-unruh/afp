abstract = """
We mechanize proofs of several results from the matching with
contracts literature, which generalize those of the classical
two-sided matching scenarios that go by the name of stable marriage.
Our focus is on game theoretic issues. Along the way we develop
executable algorithms for computing optimal stable matches."""
