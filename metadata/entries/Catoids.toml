This AFP entry formalises catoids, which are generalisations of
  single-set categories, and groupoids. More specifically, in catoids,
  the partial composition of arrows in a category is generalised to a
  multioperation, which sends pairs of elements to sets of elements,
  and the definedness condition of arrow composition -- two arrows can
  be composed if and only the target of the first matches the source
  of the second -- is relaxed. Beyond a library of basic laws for
  catoids, single-set categories and groupoids, I formalise the facts
  that every catoid can be lifted to a modal powerset quantale, that
  every groupoid can be lifted to a Dedekind quantale and to power set
  relation algebras, a special case of a famous result of JÃ³nsson and
  Tarski. Finally, I show that single-set categories are equivalent to
  a standard axiomatisation of categories based on a set of objects
  and a set of arrows, and compare catoids with related structures
  such as multimonoid and relational monoids (monoids in the monoidal
  category Rel)."""
