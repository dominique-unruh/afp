abstract = """
<p>This entry provides a formalisation of <em>parallel shear sort</em>, a comparison-based sorting
algorithm intended for highly parallel systems. It sorts $n$ elements in $O(\\log n)$ steps,
each of which involves sorting $\\sqrt{n}$ independent lists of $\\sqrt{n}$ elements each.</p>
<p>If these smaller sort operations are done in parallel with a conventional $O(n\\log n)$ sorting
algorithm, this leads to an overall work of $O(n \\log^2(n))$ and a span of 
$O(\\sqrt{n}\\log^2(n))$ -- a considerable improvement over conventional non-parallel sorting.</p>"""
