<p>This entry builds upon the results about formal and analytic Dirichlet
series to define the Hurwitz &zeta; function &zeta;(<em>a</em>,<em>s</em>) and,
based on that, the Riemann &zeta; function &zeta;(<em>s</em>).
This is done by first defining them for &real;(<em>z</em>) > 1
and then successively extending the domain to the left using the
Euler&ndash;MacLaurin formula.</p>
<p>Apart from the most basic facts such as analyticity, the following
results are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Stieltjes constants and the Laurent expansion of
&zeta;(<em>s</em>) at <em>s</em> = 1</li>
<li>the non-vanishing of &zeta;(<em>s</em>)
for &real;(<em>z</em>) &ge; 1</li>
<li>the relationship between &zeta;(<em>a</em>,<em>s</em>) and &Gamma;</li>
<li>the special values at negative integers and positive even integers</li>
<li>Hurwitz's formula and the reflection formula for &zeta;(<em>s</em>)</li>
<li>the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0405478\">
Hadjicostas&ndash;Chapman formula</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The entry also contains Euler's analytic proof of the infinitude of primes,
based on the fact that &zeta;(<i>s</i>) has a pole at <i>s</i> = 1.</p>"""
