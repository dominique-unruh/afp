<p>
An extension of classical noninterference security for deterministic
state machines, as introduced by Goguen and Meseguer and elegantly
formalized by Rushby, to nondeterministic systems should satisfy two
fundamental requirements: it should be based on a mathematically precise
theory of nondeterminism, and should be equivalent to (or at least not
weaker than) the classical notion in the degenerate deterministic case.
</p>
<p>
This paper proposes a definition of noninterference security applying
to Hoare's Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) in the general case of
a possibly intransitive noninterference policy, and proves the
equivalence of this security property to classical noninterference
security for processes representing deterministic state machines.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, McCullough's generalized noninterference security is shown
to be weaker than both the proposed notion of CSP noninterference security
for a generic process, and classical noninterference security for processes
representing deterministic state machines. This renders CSP noninterference
security preferable as an extension of classical noninterference security
to nondeterministic systems.
