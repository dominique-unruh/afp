<p>This work contains a proof of Stirling's formula both for the factorial $n! \\sim \\sqrt{2\\pi n} (n/e)^n$ on natural numbers and the real
Gamma function $\\Gamma(x)\\sim \\sqrt{2\\pi/x} (x/e)^x$. The proof is based on work by <a
href=\"http://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/~jameson/stirlgamma.pdf\">Graham Jameson</a>.</p>
<p>This is then extended to the full asymptotic expansion
$$\\log\\Gamma(z) = \\big(z - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\big)\\log z - z + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\log(2\\pi) + \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\frac{B_{k+1}}{k(k+1)} z^{-k}\\\\
{} - \\frac{1}{n} \\int_0^\\infty B_n([t])(t + z)^{-n}\\,\\text{d}t$$
uniformly for all complex $z\\neq 0$ in the cone $\\text{arg}(z)\\leq \\alpha$ for any $\\alpha\\in(0,\\pi)$, with which the above asymptotic
relation for &Gamma; is also extended to complex arguments.</p>"""
