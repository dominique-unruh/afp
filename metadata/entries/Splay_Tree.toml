Splay trees are self-adjusting binary search trees which were invented by Sleator and Tarjan [JACM 1985].
This entry provides executable and verified functional splay trees
as well as the related splay heaps (due to Okasaki).
<p>
The amortized complexity of splay trees and heaps is analyzed in the AFP entry
<a href=\"http://isa-afp.org/entries/Amortized_Complexity.html\">Amortized Complexity</a>."""
