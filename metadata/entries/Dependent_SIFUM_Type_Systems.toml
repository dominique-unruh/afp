abstract = """
The paper \"Compositional Verification and Refinement of Concurrent
Value-Dependent Noninterference\" by Murray et. al. (CSF 2016) presents
a dependent security type system for compositionally verifying a
value-dependent noninterference property, defined in (Murray, PLAS
2015), for concurrent programs. This development formalises that
security definition, the type system and its soundness proof, and
demonstrates its application on some small examples. It was derived
from the SIFUM_Type_Systems AFP entry, by Sylvia Grewe, Heiko Mantel
and Daniel Schoepe, and whose structure it inherits."""
