<p> We present an embedding of the second-order fragment of the
Theory of Abstract Objects as described in Edward Zalta's
upcoming work <a
href=\"https://mally.stanford.edu/principia.pdf\">Principia
Logico-Metaphysica (PLM)</a> in the automated reasoning
framework Isabelle/HOL. The Theory of Abstract Objects is a
metaphysical theory that reifies property patterns, as they for
example occur in the abstract reasoning of mathematics, as
<b>abstract objects</b> and provides an axiomatic
framework that allows to reason about these objects. It thereby serves
as a fundamental metaphysical theory that can be used to axiomatize
and describe a wide range of philosophical objects, such as Platonic
forms or Leibniz' concepts, and has the ambition to function as a
foundational theory of mathematics. The target theory of our embedding
as described in chapters 7-9 of PLM employs a modal relational type
theory as logical foundation for which a representation in functional
type theory is <a
href=\"https://mally.stanford.edu/Papers/rtt.pdf\">known to
be challenging</a>. </p> <p> Nevertheless we arrive
at a functioning representation of the theory in the functional logic
of Isabelle/HOL based on a semantical representation of an Aczel-model
of the theory. Based on this representation we construct an
implementation of the deductive system of PLM which allows to
automatically and interactively find and verify theorems of PLM.
</p> <p> Our work thereby supports the concept of shallow
semantical embeddings of logical systems in HOL as a universal tool
for logical reasoning <a
href=\"http://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/inf/groups/ag-ki/publications/Universal-Reasoning/1703_09620_pd.pdf\">as
promoted by Christoph Benzm&uuml;ller</a>. </p>
<p> The most notable result of the presented work is the
discovery of a previously unknown paradox in the formulation of the
Theory of Abstract Objects. The embedding of the theory in
Isabelle/HOL played a vital part in this discovery. Furthermore it was
possible to immediately offer several options to modify the theory to
guarantee its consistency. Thereby our work could provide a
significant contribution to the development of a proper grounding for
object theory. </p>"""
