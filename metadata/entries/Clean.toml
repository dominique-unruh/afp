abstract = """
Clean is based on a simple, abstract execution model for an imperative
target language. “Abstract” is understood in contrast to “Concrete
Semantics”; alternatively, the term “shallow-style embedding” could be
used. It strives for a type-safe notion of program-variables, an
incremental construction of the typed state-space, support of
incremental verification, and open-world extensibility of new type
definitions being intertwined with the program definitions. Clean is
based on a “no-frills” state-exception monad with the usual
definitions of bind and unit for the compositional glue of state-based
computations. Clean offers conditionals and loops supporting C-like
control-flow operators such as break and return. The state-space
construction is based on the extensible record package. Direct
recursion of procedures is supported. Clean’s design strives for
extreme simplicity. It is geared towards symbolic execution and proven
correct verification tools. The underlying libraries of this package,
however, deliberately restrict themselves to the most elementary
infrastructure for these tasks. The package is intended to serve as
demonstrator semantic backend for Isabelle/C, or for the
test-generation techniques."""
