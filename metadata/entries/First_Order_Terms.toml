abstract = """
We formalize basic results on first-order terms, including matching and a
first-order unification algorithm, as well as well-foundedness of the
subsumption order. This entry is part of the <i>Isabelle
Formalization of Rewriting</i> <a
href=\"http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/isafor\">IsaFoR</a>,
where first-order terms are omni-present: the unification algorithm is
used to certify several confluence and termination techniques, like
critical-pair computation and dependency graph approximations; and the
subsumption order is a crucial ingredient for completion."""
