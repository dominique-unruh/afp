We present an abstract formalization of G&ouml;del's
incompleteness theorems. We analyze sufficient conditions for the
theorems' applicability to a partially specified logic. Our
abstract perspective enables a comparison between alternative
approaches from the literature. These include Rosser's variation
of the first theorem, Jeroslow's variation of the second theorem,
and the Swierczkowski&ndash;Paulson semantics-based approach. This
AFP entry is the main entry point to the results described in our
CADE-27 paper <a
href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-29436-6_26\">A
Formally Verified Abstract Account of GÃ¶del's Incompleteness
Theorems</a>.  As part of our abstract formalization's
validation, we instantiate our locales twice in the separate AFP
entries <a
href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Goedel_HFSet_Semantic.html\">Goedel_HFSet_Semantic</a>
and <a
href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Goedel_HFSet_Semanticless.html\">Goedel_HFSet_Semanticless</a>."""
