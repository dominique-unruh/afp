This article formalizes recursive algorithms for the construction
of optimal binary search trees given fixed access frequencies.
We follow Knuth (1971), Yao (1980) and Mehlhorn (1984).
The algorithms are memoized with the help of the AFP article
<a href=\"Monad_Memo_DP.html\">Monadification, Memoization and Dynamic Programming</a>,
thus yielding dynamic programming algorithms."""
