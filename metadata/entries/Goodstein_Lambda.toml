abstract = """
In this formalization, we develop an implementation of the Goodstein
function G in plain &lambda;-calculus, linked to a concise, self-contained
specification. The implementation works on a Church-encoded
representation of countable ordinals. The initial conversion to
hereditary base 2 is not covered, but the material is sufficient to
compute the particular value G(16), and easily extends to other fixed
arguments."""
