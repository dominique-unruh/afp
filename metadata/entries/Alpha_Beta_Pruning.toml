abstract = """
Alpha-beta pruning is an efficient search strategy for two-player game trees.
It was invented in the late 1950s and is at the heart of most implementations
of combinatorial game playing programs. These theories formalize and verify a number of
variations of alpha-beta pruning, in particular fail-hard and fail-soft,
and valuations into linear orders, distributive lattices and domains with negative values.

A detailed presentation of these theories can be found in the chapter <em>Alpha-Beta Pruning</em>
in the (forthcoming) book
<a href=\"https://functional-algorithms-verified.org/functional_data_structures_algorithms.pdf\">Functional Data Structures and Algorithms --- A Proof Assistant Approach</a>."""
