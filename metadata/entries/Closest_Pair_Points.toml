This entry provides two related verified divide-and-conquer algorithms
solving the fundamental <em>Closest Pair of Points</em>
problem in Computational Geometry. Functional correctness and the
optimal running time of <em>O</em>(<em>n</em> log <em>n</em>) are
proved. Executable code is generated which is empirically competitive
with handwritten reference implementations."""
