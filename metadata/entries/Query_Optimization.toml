abstract = """
This formalization includes a general framework for query optimization
consisting of the definitions of selectivities, query graphs, join
trees, and cost functions. Furthermore, it implements the join
ordering algorithm IKKBZ using these definitions. It verifies the
correctness of these definitions and proves that IKKBZ produces an
optimal solution within a restricted solution space."""
