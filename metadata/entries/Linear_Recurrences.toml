<p> Linear recurrences with constant coefficients are an
interesting class of recurrence equations that can be solved
explicitly. The most famous example are certainly the Fibonacci
numbers with the equation <i>f</i>(<i>n</i>) =
<i>f</i>(<i>n</i>-1) +
<i>f</i>(<i>n</i> - 2) and the quite
non-obvious closed form
(<i>&phi;</i><sup><i>n</i></sup>
-
(-<i>&phi;</i>)<sup>-<i>n</i></sup>)
/ &radic;<span style=\"text-decoration:
overline\">5</span> where &phi; is the golden ratio.
</p> <p> In this work, I build on existing tools in
Isabelle &ndash; such as formal power series and polynomial
factorisation algorithms &ndash; to develop a theory of these
recurrences and derive a fully executable solver for them that can be
exported to programming languages like Haskell. </p>"""
