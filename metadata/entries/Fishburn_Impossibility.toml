abstract = """
<p>This formalisation contains the proof that there is no
anonymous Social Choice Function for at least three agents and
alternatives that fulfils both Pareto-Efficiency and
Fishburn-Strategyproofness. It was derived from a proof of <a
href=\"http://dss.in.tum.de/files/brandt-research/stratset.pdf\">Brandt
<em>et al.</em></a>, which relies on an unverified
translation of a fixed finite instance of the original problem to SAT.
This Isabelle proof contains a machine-checked version of both the
statement for exactly three agents and alternatives and the lifting to
the general case.</p>"""
