<p> Given a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and a number $s$, the
decision problem Clique asks whether $G$ contains a fully connected
subgraph with $s$ vertices. For this NP-complete problem there exists
a non-trivial lower bound: no monotone circuit of a size that is
polynomial in $n$ can solve Clique. </p><p> This entry
provides an Isabelle/HOL formalization of a concrete lower bound (the
bound is $\\sqrt[7]{n}^{\\sqrt[8]{n}}$ for the fixed choice of $s =
\\sqrt[4]{n}$), following a proof by Gordeev. </p>"""
