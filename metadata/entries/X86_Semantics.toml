abstract = """
This AFP entry provides semantics for roughly 120 different X86-64
assembly instructions. These instructions include various moves,
arithmetic/logical operations, jumps, call/return, SIMD extensions and
others. External functions are supported by allowing a user to provide
custom semantics for these calls. Floating-point operations are mapped
to uninterpreted functions. The model provides semantics for register
aliasing and a byte-level little-endian memory model. The semantics
are purposefully incomplete, but overapproximative. For example, the
precise effect of flags may be undefined for certain instructions, or
instructions may simply have no semantics at all. In those cases, the
semantics are mapped to universally quantified uninterpreted terms
from a locale. Second, this entry provides a method to symbolic
execution of basic blocks. The method, called
''se_step'' (for: symbolic execution step) fetches
an instruction and updates the current symbolic state while keeping
track of assumptions made over the memory model. A key component is a
set of theorems that prove how reads from memory resolve after writes
have occurred. Thirdly, this entry provides a parser that allows the
user to copy-paste the output of the standard disassembly tool objdump
into Isabelle/HOL. A couple small and explanatory examples are
included, including functions from the word count program. Several
examples can be supplied upon request (they are not included due to
the running time of verification): functions from the floating-point
modulo function from FDLIBM, the GLIBC strlen function and the
CoreUtils SHA256 implementation."""
