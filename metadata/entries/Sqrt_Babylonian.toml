abstract = """
We implement the Babylonian method to compute n-th roots of numbers.
We provide precise algorithms for naturals, integers and rationals, and
offer an approximation algorithm for square roots over linear ordered fields. Moreover, there
are precise algorithms to compute the floor and the ceiling of n-th roots."""
