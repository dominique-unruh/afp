This thesis presents the verification of enumeration algorithms for trees.
The first algorithm is based on the well known Pr√ºfer-correspondence and allows the enumeration of all possible labeled trees over a fixed finite set of vertices.
The second algorithm enumerates rooted, unlabeled trees of a specified size up to graph isomorphism.
It allows for the efficient enumeration without the use of an intermediate encoding of the trees with level sequences, unlike the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1137/0209055\">algorithm</a> by Beyer and Hedetniemi it is based on.
Both algorithms are formalized and verified in Isabelle/HOL.
The formalization of trees and other graph theoretic results is also presented."""
