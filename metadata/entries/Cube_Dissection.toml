This entry formalizes Littlewood's argument, demonstrating that a 3-dimensional cube cannot be dissected into a finite collection of smaller cubes, each of a different size.
The formalization addresses theorem #82, \"Dissection of Cubes (J.E. Littlewood's 'elegant' proof)\" from Freek Wiedijk's \"100 Mathematical Theorems\" list, and is based upon a prior formalization in Lean."""
