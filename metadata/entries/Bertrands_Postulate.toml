abstract = """
<p>Bertrand's postulate is an early result on the
distribution of prime numbers: For every positive integer n, there
exists a prime number that lies strictly between n and 2n.
The proof is ported from John Harrison's formalisation
in HOL Light. It proceeds by first showing that the property is true
for all n greater than or equal to 600 and then showing that it also
holds for all n below 600 by case distinction. </p>"""
