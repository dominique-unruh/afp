<p>This article provides a formalisation of Dirichlet characters
and Dirichlet <em>L</em>-functions including proofs of
their basic properties &ndash; most notably their analyticity,
their areas of convergence, and their non-vanishing for &Re;(s)
&ge; 1. All of this is built in a very high-level style using
Dirichlet series. The proof of the non-vanishing follows a very short
and elegant proof by Newman, which we attempt to reproduce faithfully
in a similar level of abstraction in Isabelle.</p> <p>This
also leads to a relatively short proof of Dirichletâ€™s Theorem, which
states that, if <em>h</em> and <em>n</em> are
coprime, there are infinitely many primes <em>p</em> with
<em>p</em> &equiv; <em>h</em> (mod
<em>n</em>).</p>"""
