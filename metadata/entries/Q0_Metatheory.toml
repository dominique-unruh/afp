abstract = "This entry is a formalization of the metatheory of \\(\\mathcal{Q}_0\\) in Isabelle/HOL. \\(\\mathcal{Q}_0\\) is a classical higher-order logic equivalent to Church's Simple Theory of Types. In this entry we formalize Chapter 5 of \"An Introduction to Mathematical Logic and Type Theory: To Truth Through Proof\" (Andrews, 2002), up to and including the proofs of soundness and consistency of \\(\\mathcal{Q}_0\\). These proof are, to the best of our knowledge, the first to be formalized in a proof assistant."
