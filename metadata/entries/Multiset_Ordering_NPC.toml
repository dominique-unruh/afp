We consider the problem of comparing two multisets via the generalized
multiset ordering. We show that the corresponding decision problem is
NP-complete. To be more precise, we encode multiset-comparisons into
propositional formulas or into conjunctive normal forms of quadratic
size; we further prove that satisfiability of conjunctive normal forms
can be encoded as multiset-comparison problems of linear size.  As a
corollary, we also show that the problem of deciding whether two terms
are related by a recursive path order is NP-hard, provided the
recursive path order is based on the generalized multiset ordering."""
