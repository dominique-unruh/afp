We formalize mixture and disintegraion of measures.
This entry is a formalization of Chapter 14.D of the book by <a
href=\"https://inria.hal.science/hal-02460214\">
Baccelli et.al.</a>
The main result is the disintegration theorem:
let $(X,\\Sigma_X)$ be a measurable space, $(Y,\\Sigma_Y)$ be a standard Borel space, $\\nu$ be a $\\sigma$-finite measure on $X \\times Y$,
and $\\nu_X$ be the marginal measure on $X$ defined by $\\nu_X(A) = \\nu(A\\times Y)$.
Assume that $\\nu_X$ is $\\sigma$-finite, then there exists a probability kernel $\\kappa$
from $X$ to $Y$ such that
\\[ \\nu(A\\times B) = \\int_A \\kappa_x (B) \\nu_X(\\mathrm{d}x), \\: A\\in\\Sigma_X, B\\in\\Sigma_Y.\\]
Such a probability kernel is unique $\\nu_X$-almost everywhere."""
