This document provides a concise overview on the core results of our
previous work on the exploration of axioms systems for category
theory. Extending the previous studies
(http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01493) we include one further axiomatic
theory in our experiments. This additional theory has been suggested
by Mac Lane in 1948. We show that the axioms proposed by Mac Lane are
equivalent to the ones we studied before, which includes an axioms set
suggested by Scott in the 1970s and another axioms set proposed by
Freyd and Scedrov in 1990, which we slightly modified to remedy a
minor technical issue."""
