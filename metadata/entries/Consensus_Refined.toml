abstract = """
Algorithms for solving the consensus problem are fundamental to
distributed computing. Despite their brevity, their
ability to operate in concurrent, asynchronous and failure-prone
environments comes at the cost of complex and subtle
behaviors. Accordingly, understanding how they work and proving
their correctness is a non-trivial endeavor where abstraction
is immensely helpful.
Moreover, research on consensus has yielded a large number of
algorithms, many of which appear to share common algorithmic
ideas. A natural question is whether and how these similarities can
be distilled and described in a precise, unified way.
In this work, we combine stepwise refinement and
lockstep models to provide an abstract and unified
view of a sizeable family of consensus algorithms. Our models
provide insights into the design choices underlying the different
algorithms, and classify them based on those choices."""
