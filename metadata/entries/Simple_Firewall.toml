abstract = """
We present a simple model of a firewall. The firewall can accept or
drop a packet and can match on interfaces, IP addresses, protocol, and
ports. It was designed to feature nice mathematical properties: The
type of match expressions was carefully crafted such that the
conjunction of two match expressions is only one match expression.
This model is too simplistic to mirror all aspects of the real world.
In the upcoming entry \"Iptables Semantics\", we will translate the
Linux firewall iptables to this model.  For a fixed service (e.g. ssh,
http), we provide an algorithm to compute an overview of the
firewall's filtering behavior. The algorithm computes minimal service
matrices, i.e. graphs which partition the complete IPv4 and IPv6
address space and visualize the allowed accesses between partitions.
