Many separation logics support <em>fractional
permissions</em> to distinguish between read and write access to
a heap location, for instance, to allow concurrent reads while
enforcing exclusive writes. The concept has been generalized to
fractional assertions. $A^p$ (where $A$ is a separation logic
assertion and $p$ a fraction between $0$ and $1$) represents a
fraction $p$ of $A$. $A^p$ holds in a state $\\sigma$ iff there exists
a state $\\sigma_A$ in which $A$ holds and $\\sigma$ is obtained from
$\\sigma_A$ by multiplying all permission amounts held by $p$.  While
$A^{p + q}$ can always be split into $A^p * A^q$, recombining $A^p *
A^q$ into $A^{p+q}$ is not always sound. We say that $A$ is
<em>combinable</em> iff the entailment $A^p * A^q \\models
A^{p+q}$ holds for any two positive fractions $p$ and $q$ such that $p
+ q \\le 1$. Combinable assertions are particularly useful to reason
about concurrent programs, for instance, to combine the postconditions
of parallel branches when they terminate. Unfortunately, the magic
wand assertion $A \\mathbin{-\\!\\!*} B$, commonly used to specify properties of
partial data structures, is typically <em>not</em>
combinable.  In this entry, we formalize a novel, restricted
definition of the magic wand, described in <a
href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11325\">a paper at CAV
22</a>, which we call the <em>combinable wand</em>.
We prove some key properties of the combinable wand; in particular, a
combinable wand is combinable if its right-hand side is combinable."""
