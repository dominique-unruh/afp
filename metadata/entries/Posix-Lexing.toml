abstract = """
<p>Brzozowski introduced the notion of derivatives for regular
expressions. They can be used for a very simple regular
expression matching algorithm. Sulzmann and Lu cleverly
extended this algorithm in order to deal with POSIX matching,
which is the underlying disambiguation strategy for regular
expressions needed in lexers. Their algorithm generates POSIX
values which encode the information of how a regular
expression matches a string--—that is, which part of the string
is matched by which part of the regular expression. In this
paper we give our inductive definition of what a POSIX value
is and show (i) that such a value is unique (for given regular
expression and string being matched) and (ii) that Sulzmann
and Lu’s algorithm always generates such a value (provided
that the regular expression matches the string). This holds
also when optimisations are included. Finally we show that
(iii) our inductive definition of a POSIX value is equivalent
to an alternative definition by Okui and Suzuki which
identifies POSIX values as least elements according to an
ordering of values.</p>"""
