abstract = """
Brzozowski introduced the notion of derivatives for regular
expressions. They can be used for a very simple regular expression
matching algorithm. Sulzmann and Lu cleverly extended this algorithm
in order to deal with POSIX matching, which is the underlying
disambiguation strategy for regular expressions needed in lexers. In
this entry we give our inductive definition of what a POSIX value is
and show (i) that such a value is unique (for given regular expression
and string being matched) and (ii) that Sulzmann and Lu's algorithm
always generates such a value (provided that the regular expression
matches the string). We also prove the correctness of an optimised
version of the POSIX matching algorithm."""
