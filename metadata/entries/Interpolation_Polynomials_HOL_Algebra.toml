<p>A well known result from algebra is that, on any field, there
is exactly one polynomial of degree less than n interpolating n points
[<a
href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511814549\">1</a>,
§7].</p> <p>This entry contains a formalization of the
above result, as well as the following generalization in the case of
finite fields <i>F</i>: There are
<i>|F|<sup>m-n</sup></i> polynomials of degree
less than <i>m ≥ n</i> interpolating the same n points,
where <i>|F|</i> denotes the size of the domain of the
field. To establish the result the entry also includes a formalization
of Lagrange interpolation, which might be of independent
interest.</p> <p>The formalized results are defined on the
algebraic structures from HOL-Algebra, which are distinct from the
type-class based structures defined in HOL. Note that there is an
existing formalization for polynomial interpolation and, in
particular, Lagrange interpolation by Thiemann and Yamada [<a
href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Polynomial_Interpolation.html\">2</a>]
on the type-class based structures in HOL.</p>"""
