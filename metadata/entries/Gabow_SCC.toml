abstract = """
We present an Isabelle/HOL formalization of Gabow's algorithm for
finding the strongly connected components of a directed graph.
Using data refinement techniques, we extract efficient code that
performs comparable to a reference implementation in Java.
Our style of formalization allows for re-using large parts of the proofs
when defining variants of the algorithm. We demonstrate this by
verifying an algorithm for the emptiness check of generalized BÃ¼chi
automata, re-using most of the existing proofs."""
