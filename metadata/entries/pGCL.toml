abstract = """
<p>pGCL is both a programming language and a specification language that
incorporates both probabilistic and nondeterministic choice, in a unified
manner. Program verification is by refinement or annotation (or both), using
either Hoare triples, or weakest-precondition entailment, in the style of
GCL.</p>
<p> This package provides both a shallow embedding of the language
primitives, and an annotation and refinement framework. The generated
document includes a brief tutorial.</p>"""
