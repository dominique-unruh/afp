Computers may help us to understand --not just verify-- philosophical
arguments. By utilizing modern proof assistants in an iterative
interpretive process, we can reconstruct and assess an argument by
fully formal means. Through the mechanization of a variant of St.
Anselm's ontological argument by E. J. Lowe, which is a
paradigmatic example of a natural-language argument with strong ties
to metaphysics and religion, we offer an ideal showcase for our
computer-assisted interpretive method."""
