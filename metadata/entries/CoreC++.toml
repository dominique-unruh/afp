abstract = "We present an operational semantics and type safety proof for multiple inheritance in C++. The semantics models the behavior of method calls, field accesses, and two forms of casts in C++ class hierarchies. For explanations see the OOPSLA 2006 paper by Wasserrab, Nipkow, Snelting and Tip."
