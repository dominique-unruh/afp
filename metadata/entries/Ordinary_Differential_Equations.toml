<p>Session Ordinary-Differential-Equations formalizes ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and initial value
problems. This work comprises proofs for local and global existence of unique solutions
(Picard-Lindel√∂f theorem). Moreover, it contains a formalization of the (continuous or even
differentiable) dependency of the flow on initial conditions as the <i>flow</i> of ODEs.</p>
