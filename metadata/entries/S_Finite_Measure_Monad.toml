abstract = """
The s-finite measure monad on quasi-Borel spaces provides a suitable denotational model for higher-order probabilistic programs with conditioning. This entry is a formalization of the s-finite measure monad and related notions, including s-finite measures, s-finite kernels, and a proof automation for quasi-Borel spaces which is an extension of our previous entry <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Quasi_Borel_Spaces.html\"><i>Quasi-Borel Spaces</i></a>. We also implement several examples of probabilistic programs in previous works and prove their property.
This work is a part of the work by Hirata, Minamide, and Sato, <i>Semantic Foundations of Higher-Order Probabilistic Programs in Isabelle/HOL</i> presented at the 14th Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP2023)."""
