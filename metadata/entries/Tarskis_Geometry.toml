abstract = """
Tarski's axioms of plane geometry are formalized and, using the standard
real Cartesian model, shown to be consistent. A substantial theory of
the projective plane is developed. Building on this theory, the
Klein-Beltrami model of the hyperbolic plane is defined and shown to
satisfy all of Tarski's axioms except his Euclidean axiom; thus Tarski's
Euclidean axiom is shown to be independent of his other axioms of plane
geometry.
