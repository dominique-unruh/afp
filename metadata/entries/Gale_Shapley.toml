This is a stepwise refinement and proof of the Gale-Shapley stable
matching (or marriage) algorithm down to executable code. Both a
purely functional implementation based on lists and a functional
implementation based on efficient arrays (provided by the Collections
Framework in the AFP) are developed. The latter implementation runs in
time <i>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</i> where
<i>n</i> is the cardinality of the two sets to be matched."""
