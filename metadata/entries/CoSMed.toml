abstract = """
This entry contains the confidentiality verification of the
(functional kernel of) the CoSMed  social media platform. The
confidentiality properties are formalized as instances of BD Security
[<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ITP.2021.3\">1</a>,
<a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Bounded_Deducibility_Security.html\">2</a>].
An innovation in the deployment of BD Security compared to previous
work is the use of dynamic declassification triggers, incorporated as
part of inductive bounds, for providing stronger guarantees that
account for the repeated opening and closing of access windows. To
further strengthen the confidentiality guarantees, we also prove
\"traceback\" properties about the accessibility decisions
affecting the information managed by the system."""
