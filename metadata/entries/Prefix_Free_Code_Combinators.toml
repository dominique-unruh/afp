abstract = """
This entry contains a set of binary encodings for primitive data
types, such as natural numbers, integers, floating-point numbers as
well as combinators to construct encodings for products, lists, sets
or functions of/between such types.  For natural numbers and integers,
the entry contains various encodings, such as Elias-Gamma-Codes and
exponential Golomb Codes, which are efficient variable-length codes in
use by current compression formats.  A use-case for this library is
measuring the persisted size of a complex data structure without
having to hand-craft a dedicated encoding for it, independent of
Isabelle's internal representation."""
