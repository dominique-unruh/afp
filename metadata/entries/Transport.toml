This entry contains the accompanying formalisation of the paper
<a href=\"https://conf.researchr.org/details/aplas-2023/aplas-2023-research-papers/15/Transport-via-Partial-Galois-Connections-and-Equivalences\">\"Transport via Partial Galois Connections and Equivalences\" (APLAS 2023)</a>.
It contains a theoretical framework to transport programs via equivalences,
subsuming the theory of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-03545-1_9\">Isabelle's Lifting package</a>.
It also contains a prototype to automate transports using this framework in Isabelle/HOL,
but this prototype is not yet ready for production.
Finally, it contains a library on top of Isabelle/HOL's axioms,
including various relativised concepts on orders, functions, binary relations,
and Galois connections and equivalences."""
