Research in information-flow security aims at developing methods to
identify undesired information leaks within programs from private
sources to public sinks. Noninterference captures this
intuition. Strong security from Sabelfeld and Sands
formalizes noninterference for concurrent systems.
<p>
We present an Isabelle/HOL formalization of strong security for
arbitrary security lattices (Sabelfeld and Sands use
a two-element security lattice in the original publication).
The formalization includes
compositionality proofs for strong security and a soundness proof
for a security type system that checks strong security for programs
in a simple while language with dynamic thread creation.
<p>
Our formalization of the security type system is abstract in the
language for expressions and in the semantic side conditions for
expressions. It can easily be instantiated with different syntactic
approximations for these side conditions. The soundness proof of
such an instantiation boils down to showing that these syntactic
approximations imply the semantic side conditions."""
