abstract = """
In this work we formalise the isomorphism between simplicial complexes
of dimension $n$ and monotone Boolean functions in $n$ variables,
mainly following the definitions and results as introduced by N. A.
Scoville. We also take advantage of the AFP
representation of <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/ROBDD.html\">ROBDD</a>
(Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams) to compute the ROBDD representation of a
given simplicial complex (by means of the isomorphism to Boolean
functions). Some examples of simplicial complexes and associated
Boolean functions are also presented."""
