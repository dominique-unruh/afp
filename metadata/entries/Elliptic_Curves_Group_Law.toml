We prove the group law for elliptic curves in Weierstrass form over
fields of characteristic greater than 2. In addition to affine
coordinates, we also formalize projective coordinates, which allow for
more efficient computations. By specializing the abstract
formalization to prime fields, we can apply the curve operations to
parameters used in standard security protocols."""
