abstract = """
We present an executable formalization of the language Promela, the
description language for models of the model checker SPIN. This
formalization is part of the work for a completely verified model
checker (CAVA), but also serves as a useful (and executable!)
description of the semantics of the language itself, something that is
currently missing.
The formalization uses three steps: It takes an abstract syntax tree
generated from an SML parser, removes syntactic sugar and enriches it
with type information. This further gets translated into a transition
system, on which the semantic engine (read: successor function) operates."""
