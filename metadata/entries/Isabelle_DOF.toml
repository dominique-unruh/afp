abstract = """
Isabelle/DOF provides an implementation of a document ontology framework on top
of Isabelle/HOL. The framework allows both for <em>defining</em> ontologies and
<em>enforcing</em> them during document development and document evolution.
Isabelle/DOF targets use-cases such as mathematical texts referring to a theory
development or technical reports requiring a particular structure. The
documentation generation features are sufficiently powerful to typeset the most
common cases without using LaTeX.

Isabelle/DOF is integrated into Isabelle's IDE, which allows for smooth ontology
development as well as immediate ontological conformance-checks during the
editing of a document. Its checking facilities leverage the collaborative
development of documents required to be consistent with an underlying
ontological structure.

This entry provides a user-manual with in-depth presentation of the
design concepts of Isabelle/DOF's Ontology Definition Language (ODL) and
describe comprehensively its major commands. Many examples show typical
best-practice applications of the system."""
