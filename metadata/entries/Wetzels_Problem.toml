Let $F$ be a set of analytic functions on the complex plane such that,
for each $z\\in\\mathbb{C}$, the set $\\{f(z) \\mid f\\in F\\}$ is
countable; must then $F$ itself be countable? The answer is yes if the
Continuum Hypothesis is false, i.e., if the cardinality of
$\\mathbb{R}$ exceeds $\\aleph_1$. But if CH is true then such an $F$,
of cardinality $\\aleph_1$, can be constructed by transfinite
recursion.  The formal proof illustrates reasoning about complex
analysis (analytic and homomorphic functions) and set theory
(transfinite cardinalities) in a single setting. The mathematical text
comes from <em>Proofs from THE BOOK</em> by Aigner and
Ziegler."""
