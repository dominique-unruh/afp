<p>A symmetric polynomial is a polynomial in variables
<em>X</em><sub>1</sub>,&hellip;,<em>X</em><sub>n</sub>
that does not discriminate between its variables, i.&thinsp;e. it
is invariant under any permutation of them. These polynomials are
important in the study of the relationship between the coefficients of
a univariate polynomial and its roots in its algebraic
closure.</p> <p>This article provides a definition of
symmetric polynomials and the elementary symmetric polynomials
e<sub>1</sub>,&hellip;,e<sub>n</sub> and
proofs of their basic properties, including three notable
ones:</p> <ul> <li> Vieta's formula, which
gives an explicit expression for the <em>k</em>-th
coefficient of a univariate monic polynomial in terms of its roots
<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>,&hellip;,<em>x</em><sub>n</sub>,
namely
<em>c</em><sub><em>k</em></sub> = (-1)<sup><em>n</em>-<em>k</em></sup>&thinsp;e<sub><em>n</em>-<em>k</em></sub>(<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>,&hellip;,<em>x</em><sub>n</sub>).</li>
<li>Second, the Fundamental Theorem of Symmetric Polynomials,
which states that any symmetric polynomial is itself a uniquely
determined polynomial combination of the elementary symmetric
polynomials.</li> <li>Third, as a corollary of the
previous two, that given a polynomial over some ring
<em>R</em>, any symmetric polynomial combination of its
roots is also in <em>R</em> even when the roots are not.
</ul> <p> Both the symmetry property itself and the
witness for the Fundamental Theorem are executable. </p>"""
