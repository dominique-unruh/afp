<p>This article provides formal proofs of basic properties of
Mersenne numbers, i. e. numbers of the form
2<sup><em>n</em></sup> - 1, and especially of
Mersenne primes.</p> <p>In particular, an efficient,
verified, and executable version of the Lucas&ndash;Lehmer test is
developed. This test decides primality for Mersenne numbers in time
polynomial in <em>n</em>.</p>"""
