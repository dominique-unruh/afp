abstract = "This entry includes a formalization of standard Borel spaces and (a variant of) the Borel isomorphism theorem. A separable complete metrizable topological space is called a polish space and a measurable space generated from a polish space is called a standard Borel space. We formalize the notion of standard Borel spaces by establishing set-based metric spaces, and then prove (a variant of) the Borel isomorphism theorem. The theorem states that a standard Borel spaces is either a countable discrete space or isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$."
