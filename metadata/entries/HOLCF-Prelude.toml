abstract = """
The Isabelle/HOLCF-Prelude is a formalization of a large part of
Haskell's standard prelude in Isabelle/HOLCF. We use it to prove
the correctness of the Eratosthenes' Sieve, in its
self-referential implementation commonly used to showcase
Haskell's laziness; prove correctness of GHC's
\"fold/build\" rule and related rewrite rules; and certify a
number of hints suggested by HLint."""
