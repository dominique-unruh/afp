abstract = """
This theory proves a theorem of Birkhoff that asserts that any
finite distributive lattice is isomorphic to the set of
<em>down-sets</em> of that lattice's join-irreducible elements. The
isomorphism preserves order, meets and joins as well as
complementation in the case the lattice is a Boolean algebra. A
consequence of this representation theorem is that every finite
Boolean algebra is isomorphic to a powerset algebra."""
