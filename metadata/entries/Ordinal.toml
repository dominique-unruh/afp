abstract = "This development defines a well-ordered type of countable ordinals. It includes notions of continuous and normal functions, recursively defined functions over ordinals, least fixed-points, and derivatives. Much of ordinal arithmetic is formalized, including exponentials and logarithms. The development concludes with formalizations of Cantor Normal Form and Veblen hierarchies over normal functions."
