We present a formalization of Matiyasevich's proof of the DPRM
theorem, which states that every recursively enumerable set of natural
numbers is Diophantine. This result from 1970 yields a negative
solution to Hilbert's 10th problem over the integers. To
represent recursively enumerable sets in equations, we implement and
arithmetize register machines. We formalize a general theory of
Diophantine sets and relations to reason about them abstractly. Using
several number-theoretic lemmas, we prove that exponentiation has a
Diophantine representation."""
