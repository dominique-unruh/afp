We verify purely functional, simple and efficient implementations of
Prim's and Dijkstra's algorithms. This constitutes the first
verification of an executable and even efficient version of
Prim's algorithm. This entry formalizes the second part of our
ITP-2019 proof pearl <em>Purely Functional, Simple and Efficient
Priority Search Trees and Applications to Prim and Dijkstra</em>."""
