We extend the ZF-Constructibility library by relativizing theories of
the Isabelle/ZF and Delta System Lemma sessions to a transitive class.
We also relativize Paulson's work on Aleph and our former
treatment of the Axiom of Dependent Choices. This work is a
prerrequisite to our formalization of the independence of the
Continuum Hypothesis."""
