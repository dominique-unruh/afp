abstract = """
These theories contain a formalization of first class type constructors
and axiomatic constructor classes for HOLCF. This work is described
in detail in the ICFP 2012 paper <i>Formal Verification of Monad
Transformers</i> by the author. The formalization is a revised and
updated version of earlier joint work with Matthews and White.
<P>
Based on the hierarchy of type classes in Haskell, we define classes
for functors, monads, monad-plus, etc. Each one includes all the
standard laws as axioms. We also provide a new user command,
tycondef, for defining new type constructors in HOLCF. Using tycondef,
we instantiate the type class hierarchy with various monads and monad
transformers."""
