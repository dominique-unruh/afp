<p> Skip lists are sorted linked lists enhanced with shortcuts
and are an alternative to binary search trees. A skip lists consists
of multiple levels of sorted linked lists where a list on level n is a
subsequence of the list on level n âˆ’ 1. In the ideal case, elements
are skipped in such a way that a lookup in a skip lists takes O(log n)
time. In a randomised skip list the skipped elements are choosen
randomly. </p> <p> This entry contains formalized proofs
of the textbook results about the expected height and the expected
length of a search path in a randomised skip list. </p>"""
