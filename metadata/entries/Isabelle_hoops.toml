abstract = "<p>We formalize a well known result in theory of hoops: every totally ordered hoop can be written as an ordinal sum of irreducible (equivalently Wajsberg) hoops. This formalization is based on the proof for BL-chains (i.e., bounded totally ordered hoops) found in <cite>Decomposition of BL-chains</cite> by M. Busaniche (Algebra Universalis, 2005). </p>"
