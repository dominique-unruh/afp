abstract = """
<p>This article provides a formalisation of continued fractions of real numbers and their basic properties.
It also contains a proof of the classic result that the irrational numbers with periodic continued
 fraction expansions are precisely the quadratic irrationals, i.e. real numbers that fulfil a non-trivial quadratic equation $a x^2 + b x + c = 0$ with integer coefficients.</p>
<p>
Particular attention is given to the continued fraction expansion of $\\sqrt{D}$ for a non-square
 natural number $D$. Basic results about the length and structure of its period are provided,
 along with an executable algorithm to compute the period (and from it, the entire expansion).</p>
<p>
This is then also used to provide a fairly efficient, executable, and fully formalised algorithm to
compute solutions to Pell's equation $x^2 - D y^2 = 1$. The performance is sufficiently good to
find the solution to Archimedes's cattle problem in less than a second on a typical computer.
This involves the value $D = 410286423278424$, for which the solution has over 200000 decimals.</p>
<p>
Lastly, a derivation of the continued fraction expansions of Euler's number $e$ and an executable
function to compute continued fraction expansions using interval arithmetic is also provided.</p>"""
