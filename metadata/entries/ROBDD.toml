abstract = """
We present a verified and executable implementation of ROBDDs in
Isabelle/HOL. Our implementation relates pointer-based computation in
the Heap monad to operations on an abstract definition of boolean
functions. Internally, we implemented the if-then-else combinator in a
recursive fashion, following the Shannon decomposition of the argument
functions. The implementation mixes and adapts known techniques and is
built with efficiency in mind."""
