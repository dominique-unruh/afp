Bounded natural functors (BNFs) provide a modular framework for the
construction of (co)datatypes in higher-order logic.  Their functorial
operations, the mapper and relator, are restricted to a subset of the
parameters, namely those where recursion can take place.  For certain
applications, such as free theorems, data refinement, quotients, and
generalised rewriting, it is desirable that these operations do not
ignore the other parameters.  In this article, we formalise the
generalisation BNF<sub>CC</sub> that extends the mapper
and relator to covariant and contravariant parameters.  We show that
<ol> <li> BNF<sub>CC</sub>s are closed under
functor composition and least and greatest fixpoints,</li>
<li> subtypes inherit the BNF<sub>CC</sub> structure
under conditions that generalise those for the BNF case,
and</li> <li> BNF<sub>CC</sub>s preserve
quotients under mild conditions.</li> </ol> These proofs
are carried out for abstract BNF<sub>CC</sub>s similar to
the AFP entry BNF Operations.  In addition, we apply the
BNF<sub>CC</sub> theory to several concrete functors."""
