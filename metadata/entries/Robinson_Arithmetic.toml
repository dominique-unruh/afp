We instantiate our syntax-independent logic infrastructure developed
in <a
href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Syntax_Independent_Logic.html\">a
separate AFP entry</a> to the FOL theory of Robinson arithmetic
(also known as Q). The latter was formalised using Nominal Isabelle by
adapting <a

Paulsonâ€™s formalization of the Hereditarily Finite Set
theory</a>."""
