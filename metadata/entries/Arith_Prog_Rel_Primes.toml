This article provides a formalization of the solution obtained by the
author of the Problem “ARITHMETIC PROGRESSIONS” from the
<a href=\"https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~wwu/riddles/putnam.shtml\">
Putnam exam problems of 2002</a>. The statement of the problem is
as follows: For which integers <em>n</em> > 1 does the set of positive
integers less than and relatively prime to <em>n</em> constitute an
arithmetic progression?"""
