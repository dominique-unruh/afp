<p>This entry presents a short derivation of the cardinality of $\\mathbb{R}$,
namely that $|\\mathbb{R}| = |2^{\\mathbb{N}}| = 2^{\\aleph_0}$. This is done by showing the
injection $\\mathbb{R}\\to 2^{\\mathbb{Q}},\\ x \\mapsto (-\\infty, x)\\cap\\mathbb{Q}$ (i.e. Dedekind cuts)
for one direction and the injection $2^\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{Q},\\ X \\mapsto \\sum_{n\\in X} 3^{-n}$,
i.e. ternary fractions, for the other direction.</p>"""
