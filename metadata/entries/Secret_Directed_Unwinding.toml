abstract = """
This entry formalizes the secret-directed unwinding disproof method for relative security. The method was presented in the CSF 2024 paper \"Relative Security: Formally Modeling and (Dis)Proving Resilience Against Semantic Optimization Vulnerabilities\". Secret-directed unwinding can be used to prove the existence of transient execution vulnerabilities.

The main characteristics of secret-directed unwinding are that (1) it is used to disprove rather than prove security and (2) it proceeds in a manner that is \"directed\" by given sequences of secrets. The second characteristic is shared with the unwinding method for bounded- deducibility security."""
