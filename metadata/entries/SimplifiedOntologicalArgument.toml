abstract = """
<p>Simplified variants of Gödel's ontological argument are
explored. Among those is a particularly interesting simplified
argument which is (i) valid already in basic
modal logics K or KT, (ii) which does not suffer from modal collapse,
and (iii) which avoids the rather complex predicates of essence (Ess.)
and necessary existence (NE) as used by Gödel.
</p><p>
Whether the presented variants increase or decrease the
attractiveness and persuasiveness of the ontological argument is a
question I would like to pass on to philosophy and theology.
