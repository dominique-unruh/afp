abstract = "This work presents a formalization of a library for automata on bit strings. It forms the basis of a reflection-based decision procedure for Presburger arithmetic, which is efficiently executable thanks to Isabelle's code generator. With this work, we therefore provide a mechanized proof of a well-known connection between logic and automata theory. The formalization is also described in a publication [TPHOLs 2009]."
