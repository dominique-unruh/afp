abstract = "&gamma;-CVP is the problem of finding a vector in L that is within &gamma; times the closest possible to t, where L is a lattice and t is a target vector. If the basis for L is LLL-reduced, Babai's Closest Hyperplane algorithm solves &gamma;-CVP for &gamma;=2<sup>n/2</sup>, where n is the dimension of the lattice L, in time polynomial in n. This session formalizes said algorithm, using the AFP formalization of LLL and adapting a proof of correctness from the lecture notes of Stephens-Davidowitz."
