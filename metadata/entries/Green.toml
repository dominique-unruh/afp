abstract = """
We formalise a statement of Green’s theorem—the first formalisation to
our knowledge—in Isabelle/HOL. The theorem statement that we formalise
is enough for most applications, especially in physics and
engineering. Our formalisation is made possible by a novel proof that
avoids the ubiquitous line integral cancellation argument. This
eliminates the need to formalise orientations and region boundaries
explicitly with respect to the outwards-pointing normal vector.
Instead we appeal to a homological argument about equivalences between
paths."""
