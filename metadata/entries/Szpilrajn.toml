abstract = """
This entry is concerned with the principle of order extension, i.e. the extension of an order relation to a total order relation.
To this end, we prove a more general version of Szpilrajn's extension theorem employing terminology from the book \"Consistency, Choice, and Rationality\" by Bossert and Suzumura.
We also formalize theorem 2.7 of their book."""
