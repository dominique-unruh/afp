We mechanise the logic TLA*
<a href=\"http://www.springerlink.com/content/ax3qk557qkdyt7n6/\">[Merz 1999]</a>,
an extension of Lamport's  Temporal Logic of Actions (TLA)
<a href=\"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=177492.177726\">[Lamport 1994]</a>
for specifying and reasoning
about concurrent and reactive systems. Aiming at a framework for mechanising]  the verification of TLA (or TLA*) specifications, this contribution reuses
some elements from a previous axiomatic encoding of TLA in Isabelle/HOL
by the second author [Merz 1998], which has been part of the Isabelle
distribution. In contrast to that previous work, we give here a shallow,
definitional embedding, with the following highlights:
<ul>
<li>a theory of infinite sequences, including a formalisation of the concepts of stuttering invariance central to TLA and TLA*;
<li>a definition of the semantics of TLA*, which extends TLA by a mutually-recursive definition of formulas and pre-formulas, generalising TLA action formulas;
<li>a substantial set of derived proof rules, including the TLA* axioms and Lamport's proof rules for system verification;
<li>a set of examples illustrating the usage of Isabelle/TLA* for reasoning about systems.
</ul>
Note that this work is unrelated to the ongoing development of a proof system
for the specification language TLA+, which includes an encoding of TLA+ as a
new Isabelle object logic <a href=\"http://www.springerlink.com/content/354026160p14j175/\">[Chaudhuri et al 2010]</a>."""
