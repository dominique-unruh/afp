We formalize the L&eacute;vy-Prokhorov metric, a metric on finite measures,
mainly following the lecture notes by <a href=\"https://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/~vangaans/jancol1.pdf\"><i>Gaans</i></a>.
This entry includes the following formalization.
<ul>
  <li> Characterizations of closed sets, open sets, and topology by limit.</li>
  <li> A special case of Alaoglu's theorem.</li>
  <li> Weak convergence and the Portmanteau theorem.</li>
  <li> The L&eacute;vy-Prokhorov metric and its completeness and separability.</li>
  <li> The equivalence of the topology of weak convergence and the topology generated by the L&eacute;vy-Prokhorov metric.</li>
  <li> Prokhorov's theorem.</li>
  <li> Equality of two $\\sigma$-algebras on the space of finite measures. One is the Borel algebra of the L&eacute;vy-Prokhorov metric and the other is the least $\\sigma$-algebra that makes  $(\\lambda\\mu.\\: \\mu(A))$ measurable for all measurable sets $A$.</li>
  <li> The space of finite measures on a standard Borel space is also a standard Borel space.</li>
