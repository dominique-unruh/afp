abstract = """
This paper constructs a formal model of a Diffie-Hellman
password-based authentication protocol between a user and a smart
card, and proves its security. The protocol provides for the dispatch
of the user's password to the smart card on a secure messaging
channel established by means of Password Authenticated Connection
Establishment (PACE), where the mapping method being used is Chip
Authentication Mapping. By applying and suitably extending
Paulson's Inductive Method, this paper proves that the protocol
establishes trustworthy secure messaging channels, preserves the
secrecy of users' passwords, and provides an effective mutual
authentication service. What is more, these security properties turn
out to hold independently of the secrecy of the PACE authentication
key."""
