abstract = """
While the DOM with shadow trees provide the technical basis for
defining web components, the DOM standard neither defines the concept
of web components nor specifies the safety properties that web
components should guarantee. Consequently, the standard also does not
discuss how or even if the methods for modifying the DOM respect
component boundaries.  In AFP entry, we present a formally verified
model of web components and define safety properties which ensure that
different web components can only interact with each other using
well-defined interfaces. Moreover, our verification of the application
programming interface (API) of the DOM revealed numerous invariants
that implementations of the DOM API need to preserve to ensure the
integrity of components."""
