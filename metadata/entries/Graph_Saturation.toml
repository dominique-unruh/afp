abstract = """
This is an Isabelle/HOL formalisation of graph saturation, closely
following a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jlamp.2018.06.005\">paper by the author</a> on graph saturation.
Nine out of ten lemmas of the original paper are proven in this
formalisation. The formalisation additionally includes two theorems
that show the main premise of the paper: that consistency and
entailment are decided through graph saturation. This formalisation
does not give executable code, and it did not implement any of the
optimisations suggested in the paper."""
