abstract = """
Isabelle's code generator performs various adaptations for target
languages. Among others, constructor applications have to be fully
saturated. That means that for constructor calls occuring as arguments
to higher-order functions, synthetic lambdas have to be inserted. This
entry provides tooling to avoid this construction altogether by
introducing constructor functions."""
