<p>CryptHOL provides a framework for formalising cryptographic arguments
in Isabelle/HOL. It shallowly embeds a probabilistic functional
programming language in higher order logic. The language features
monadic sequencing, recursion, random sampling, failures and failure
handling, and black-box access to oracles. Oracles are probabilistic
functions which maintain hidden state between different invocations.
All operators are defined in the new semantic domain of
generative probabilistic values, a codatatype. We derive proof rules for
the operators and establish a connection with the theory of relational
parametricity. Thus, the resuting proofs are trustworthy and
comprehensible, and the framework is extensible and widely applicable.
</p><p>
The framework is used in the accompanying AFP entry \"Game-based
Cryptography in HOL\". There, we show-case our framework by formalizing
different game-based proofs from the literature. This formalisation
continues the work described in the author's ESOP 2016 paper.</p>"""
