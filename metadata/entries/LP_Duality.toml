abstract = """
We formalize the weak and strong duality theorems of linear
programming. For the strong duality theorem we provide three
sufficient preconditions: both the primal problem and the dual problem
are satisfiable, the primal problem is satisfiable and bounded, or the
dual problem is satisfiable and bounded. The proofs are based on an
existing formalization of Farkas' Lemma."""
