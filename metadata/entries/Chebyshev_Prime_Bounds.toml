<p>
This entry derives explicit lower and upper bounds for Chebyshev's prime counting functions
\\[\\psi(x) = \\sum_{\\substack{p^k \\leq x \\\\ k > 0}} \\log p\\hskip4em \\vartheta(x) = \\sum_{p\\leq x} \\log p\\ .\\]
</p>
<p>
Concretely, the following inequalities are proven:</p>
<ul>
<li>$\\psi(x)\\geq 0.9x$ for $x\\geq 41$</li>
<li>$\\vartheta(x) \\geq 0.82x$ if $x\\geq 97$</li>
<li>$\\vartheta(x) \\leq \\psi(x) \\leq 1.2x$ if $x\\geq 0$</li>
</ul>
<p>
The proofs work by careful estimation of $\\psi(x)$, with
Stirling's formula as a starting point, to prove the bound for 
all $x\\geq x_0$ with a concrete $x_0$, followed by brute-force
approximation for all $x$ below $x_0$.</p>

<p>An easy corollary of this is <em>Bertrand's postulate</em>, i.e. the fact that for any
$x > 1$ the interval $(x,2x)$ contains at least one prime (a fact that has already
been shown in the AFP using weaker bounds for $\\psi$ and $\\vartheta$).</p>"""
