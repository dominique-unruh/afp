This entry formalizes the coproduct measure.
Let $I$ be a set and $\\{M_i\\}_{i\\in I}$ measurable spaces.
The $\\sigma$-algebra
on $\\coprod_{i\\in I} M_i = \\{(i,x)\\mid i\\in I\\land x\\in M_i\\}$
is defined as the least one making $(\\lambda x.\\: (i,x))$ measurable for all $i\\in I$.
Let $\\mu_i$ be measures on $M_i$ for all $i\\in I$ and $A$ a measurable set of $\\coprod_{i\\in I} M_i$.
The coproduct measure $\\coprod_{i\\in I} \\mu_i$ is defined as follows:
\\[\\left(\\coprod_{i\\in I} \\mu_i\\right)(A) = \\sum_{i\\in I} \\mu_i(A_i), \\quad \\text{where $A_i = \\{x\\mid (i,x)\\in A\\}$.}\\]
 
We also prove the relationship with coproduct quasi-Borel spaces:
the functor $R: \\mathbf{Meas}\\to\\mathbf{QBS}$ preserves countable coproducts."""
