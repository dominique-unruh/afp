This work presents a formalisation of a generating function proof for
Lucas's theorem. We first outline extensions to the existing
Formal Power Series (FPS) library, including an equivalence relation
for coefficients modulo <em>n</em>, an alternate binomial theorem statement,
and a formalised proof of the Freshman's dream (mod <em>p</em>) lemma.
The second part of the work presents the formal proof of Lucas's
Theorem. Working backwards, the formalisation first proves a well
known corollary of the theorem which is easier to formalise, and then
applies induction to prove the original theorem statement. The proof
of the corollary aims to provide a good example of a formalised
generating function equivalence proof using the FPS library. The final
theorem statement is intended to be integrated into the formalised
proof of Hilbert's 10th Problem."""
