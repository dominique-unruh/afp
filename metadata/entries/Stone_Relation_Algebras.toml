abstract = """
We develop Stone relation algebras, which generalise relation algebras
by replacing the underlying Boolean algebra structure with a Stone
algebra. We show that finite matrices over extended real numbers form
an instance. As a consequence, relation-algebraic concepts and methods
can be used for reasoning about weighted graphs. We also develop a
fixpoint calculus and apply it to compare different definitions of
reflexive-transitive closures in semirings."""
