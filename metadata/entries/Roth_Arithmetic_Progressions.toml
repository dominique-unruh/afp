We formalise a proof of Roth's Theorem on Arithmetic
Progressions, a major result in additive combinatorics on the
existence of 3-term arithmetic progressions in subsets of natural
numbers. To this end, we follow a proof using graph regularity. We
employ our recent formalisation of Szemerédi's Regularity Lemma,
a major result in extremal graph theory, which we use here to prove
the Triangle Counting Lemma and the Triangle Removal Lemma. Our
sources are Yufei Zhao's MIT lecture notes
