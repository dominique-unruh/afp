abstract = """
We provide a framework for program and data refinement in Isabelle/HOL.
The framework is based on a nondeterminism-monad with assertions, i.e.,
the monad carries a set of results or an assertion failure.
Recursion is expressed by fixed points. For convenience, we also provide
while and foreach combinators.
<p>
The framework provides tools to automatize canonical tasks, such as
verification condition generation, finding appropriate data refinement relations,
and refine an executable program to a form that is accepted by the
Isabelle/HOL code generator.
<p>
This submission comes with a collection of examples and a user-guide,
illustrating the usage of the framework."""
