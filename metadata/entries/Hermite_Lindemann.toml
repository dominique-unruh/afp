<p>This article provides a formalisation of the
Hermite-Lindemann-Weierstraß Theorem (also known as simply
Hermite-Lindemann or Lindemann-Weierstraß). This theorem is one of the
crowning achievements of 19th century number theory.</p>
<p>The theorem states that if $\\alpha_1, \\ldots,
\\alpha_n\\in\\mathbb{C}$ are algebraic numbers that are linearly
independent over $\\mathbb{Z}$, then $e^{\\alpha_1},\\ldots,e^{\\alpha_n}$
are algebraically independent over $\\mathbb{Q}$.</p>
<p>Like the <a
href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-66107-0_5\">previous
formalisation in Coq by Bernard</a>, I proceeded by formalising
<a
href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511565977\">Baker's
version of the theorem and proof</a> and then deriving the
original one from that. Baker's version states that for any
algebraic numbers $\\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_n\\in\\mathbb{C}$ and distinct
algebraic numbers $\\alpha_i, \\ldots, \\alpha_n\\in\\mathbb{C}$, we have
$\\beta_1 e^{\\alpha_1} + \\ldots + \\beta_n e^{\\alpha_n} = 0$ if and only
if all the $\\beta_i$ are zero.</p> <p>This has a number of
direct corollaries, e.g.:</p> <ul> <li>$e$ and $\\pi$
are transcendental</li> <li>$e^z$, $\\sin z$, $\\tan z$,
etc. are transcendental for algebraic
$z\\in\\mathbb{C}\\setminus\\{0\\}$</li> <li>$\\ln z$ is
transcendental for algebraic $z\\in\\mathbb{C}\\setminus\\{0,
1\\}$</li> </ul>"""
