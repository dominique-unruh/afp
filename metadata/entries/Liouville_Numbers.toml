<p>
Liouville numbers are a class of transcendental numbers that can be approximated
particularly well with rational numbers. Historically, they were the first
numbers whose transcendence was proven.
</p><p>
In this entry, we define the concept of Liouville numbers as well as the
standard construction to obtain Liouville numbers (including Liouville's
constant) and we prove their most important properties: irrationality and
transcendence.
</p><p>
The proof is very elementary and requires only standard arithmetic, the Mean
Value Theorem for polynomials, and the boundedness of polynomials on compact
intervals.
