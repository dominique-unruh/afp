<a
href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szemerédi_regularity_lemma\">Szemerédi's
regularity lemma</a> is a key result in the study of large
graphs. It asserts the existence of an upper bound on the number of parts
the vertices of a graph need to be partitioned into such that the
edges between the parts are random in a certain sense. This bound
depends only on the desired precision and not on the graph itself, in
the spirit of Ramsey's theorem. The formalisation follows online
course notes by <a href=\"https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~par31/notes/tic.pdf\">Tim
Gowers</a> and <a href=\"https://yufeizhao.com/gtacbook/\">Yufei
