abstract = "We present a mechanisation of (preference-based) conditional normative reasoning. Our focus is on Åqvist’s system E for conditional obligation and its extensions. We present both a correspondence-theory-focused metalogical study and a use-case application to Parfit’s repugnant conclusion, focusing on the mere addition paradox. Our contribution is explained in detail in [2]. This document presents a corresponding (but sligthly modified) Isabelle/HOL dataset."
