abstract = """
<p>The most efficient known primality tests are
<em>probabilistic</em> in the sense that they use
randomness and may, with some probability, mistakenly classify a
composite number as prime &ndash; but never a prime number as
composite. Examples of this are the Miller&ndash;Rabin test, the
Solovay&ndash;Strassen test, and (in most cases) Fermat's
test.</p> <p>This entry defines these three tests and
proves their correctness. It also develops some of the
number-theoretic foundations, such as Carmichael numbers and the
Jacobi symbol with an efficient executable algorithm to compute
it.</p>"""
