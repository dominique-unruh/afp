abstract = """
A framework for the analysis of the amortized complexity of functional
data structures is formalized in Isabelle/HOL and applied to a number of
standard examples and to the folowing non-trivial ones: skew heaps,
splay trees, splay heaps and pairing heaps.
<p>
A preliminary version of this work (without pairing heaps) is described
in a <a href=\"http://www21.in.tum.de/~nipkow/pubs/itp15.html\">paper</a>
published in the proceedings of the conference on Interactive
Theorem Proving ITP 2015. An extended version of this publication
is available <a href=\"http://www21.in.tum.de/~nipkow/pubs/jfp16.html\">here</a>."""
