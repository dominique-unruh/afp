abstract = """
We formalize a combination algorithm to preprocess a set of linear
diophantine equations and inequalities. It consists of three techniques that are applied
exhaustively.
<ul>
<li>Pugh's technique of tightening linear inequalities,</li>
<li>Bromberger and Weidenbach's algorithm to detect implicit equalities &ndash; here we make use of an incremental implementation of the simplex algorithm, and</li>
<li>Griggio's diophantine equation solver to eliminate all detected equations.</li>
</ul>

In total, given some linear input constraints, the preprocessor will either detect unsatisfiability 
in \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), 
or it returns equi-satisfiable inequalities, which moreover are all strictly satisfiable 
in \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\)."""
