abstract = """
Recently, a modern version of Roscoes and Brookes Failure-Divergence Semantics for CSP has been formalized in Isabelle: HOL-CSP.
The session HOL-CSP introduces among other things some binary operators on processes that we will here generalize in a fully-abstract way.
On these \"architectural operators\", we will prove the properties of refinement, the rules of continuity and the laws of interaction so that they can be
easily used.
Finally, we will give examples of their usefulness when trying to model complex systems."""
