abstract = """
We formalize quantum Hoare logic as given in [1]. In particular, we
specify the syntax and denotational semantics of a simple model of
quantum programs. Then, we write down the rules of quantum Hoare logic
for partial correctness, and show the soundness and completeness of
the resulting proof system. As an application, we verify the
correctness of Groverâ€™s algorithm."""
