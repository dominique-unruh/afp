<p>In this article, I formalise a proof from <a
href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-57265-8\">THE
BOOK</a>; namely a formula that was called ‘one of the most
beautiful formulas involving elementary functions’:</p> \\[\\pi
\\cot(\\pi z) = \\frac{1}{z} + \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\left(\\frac{1}{z+n} +
\\frac{1}{z-n}\\right)\\] <p>The proof uses Herglotz's trick
to show the real case and analytic continuation for the complex
case.</p>"""
