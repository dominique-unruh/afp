abstract = "We introduce a theory of infinite lists in HOL formalized as functions over naturals (folder ListInf, theories ListInf and ListInf_Prefix). It also provides additional results for finite lists (theory ListInf/List2), natural numbers (folder CommonArith, esp. division/modulo, naturals with infinity), sets (folder CommonSet, esp. cutting/truncating sets, traversing sets of naturals)."
