Lenses provide an abstract interface for manipulating data types
through spatially-separated views. They are defined abstractly in
terms of two functions, <em>get</em>, the return a value
from the source type, and <em>put</em> that updates the
value. We mechanise the underlying theory of lenses, in terms of an
algebraic hierarchy of lenses, including well-behaved and very
well-behaved lenses, each lens class being characterised by a set of
lens laws. We also mechanise a lens algebra in Isabelle that enables
their composition and comparison, so as to allow construction of
complex lenses. This is accompanied by a large library of algebraic
laws. Moreover we also show how the lens classes can be applied by
instantiating them with a number of Isabelle data types."""
