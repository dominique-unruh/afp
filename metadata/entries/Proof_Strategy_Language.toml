abstract = """
Isabelle includes various automatic tools for finding proofs under
certain conditions. However, for each conjecture, knowing which
automation to use, and how to tweak its parameters, is currently
labour intensive. We have developed a language, PSL, designed to
capture high level proof strategies. PSL offloads the construction of
human-readable fast-to-replay proof scripts to automatic search,
making use of search-time information about each conjecture. Our
preliminary evaluations show that PSL reduces the labour cost of
interactive theorem proving. This submission contains the
implementation of PSL and an example theory file, Example.thy, showing
how to write poof strategies in PSL."""
