This is a formalization of Markov models in Isabelle/HOL. It
builds on Isabelle's probability theory. The available models are
currently Discrete-Time Markov Chains and a extensions of them with
rewards.
<p>
As application of these models we formalize probabilistic model
checking of pCTL formulas, analysis of IPv4 address allocation in
ZeroConf and an analysis of the anonymity of the Crowds protocol.
