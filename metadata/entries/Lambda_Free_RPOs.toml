abstract = "This Isabelle/HOL formalization defines recursive path orders (RPOs) for higher-order terms without lambda-abstraction and proves many useful properties about them. The main order fully coincides with the standard RPO on first-order terms also in the presence of currying, distinguishing it from previous work. An optimized variant is formalized as well. It appears promising as the basis of a higher-order superposition calculus."
