text \<open>Files in this directory are intended to be added to other theory files when the next AFP 
      release is near. The reason why they are currently held in a separate file is that this will
      lessen the severity of merge conflicts due to changes made to the Complex_Bounded_Operators
      session in the development branch of the AFP by the AFP maintainers.\<close>

(* basis_enum should define "canonical_basis_length" (or maybe "dimension" or something). Reason: code generation otherwise has to 
    compute the length of canonical_basis each time the dimension is needed.
   Or it could be in the/a type class "finite_dim".
