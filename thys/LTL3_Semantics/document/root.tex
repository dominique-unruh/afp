\title{Definitive Set Semantics for LTL3}
\author{Rayhana Amjad, Rob van Glabbeek, Liam O'Connor}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
\ltlthree is a multi-valued variant of \LTL for runtime verification applications, originally due to Bauer et al~\cite{ltl3tosem}. The semantic descriptions of \ltlthree in previous work are given only in terms of the relationship to conventional LTL\@. In this submission, which accompanies our EXPRESS/SOS 2024 paper~\cite{expresssos}, we instead give a full model-based inductive accounting of the semantics of \ltlthree, in terms of families of \emph{definitive prefix sets}. We show that our definitive prefix sets are isomorphic to \LT temporal properties (sets of infinite traces), and thereby show that our semantics of \ltlthree directly correspond to the semantics of conventional LTL\@. In addition, we formalise the formula progression evaluation technique~\cite{progress1,progress2}, popularly used in runtime verification and testing contexts, and show its soundness and completeness up to finite traces with respect to our semantics.
