abstract="We have described a scheme that allows timing assumptions to be incorporated into automatic proofs of arbitrary finite-state temporal properties. The obvious extension is to be able to prove timing properties, not just assume them. This would provide a verification framework for finite-state hard real-time systems. We conjecture that the method presented can, in fact, be extended in this way.",
