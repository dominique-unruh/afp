\title{Two Theorems on Hermitian Matrices}
\author{Sage Binder and Zilin Jiang}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    We formalize two results on Hermitian matrices.
    First, Sylvester's criterion: a hermitian matrix
    is positive definite if and only if all its leading principal submatrices
    have positive determinant.
    Second, Cauchy's eigenvalue interlacing theorem:
    given a principal submatrix $B$ of a hermitian matrix $A$,
    the eigenvalues of $B$ interlace those of $A$.

    Our approach to Sylvester's criterion is fairly standard,
    and required us to formalize Schur's block matrix determinant formula,
    which gives a formula for the determinant of a block matrix $(A, B, C, D)$
    when $A$ is invertible.

    Our approach to Cauchy's eigenvalue interlacing theorem
    follows a proof given in a set of lecture notes by Dr. David Bindel \cite{bindel2019lecture}.
    This approach involved formalizing the Courant-Fischer minimax theorem
    (a theorem about the Rayleigh quotient, which we define in this entry).
    In our statement of the Courant-Fischer minimax theorem,
    we refer to the infimum and supremum instead of the minimum and maximum,
    as this simplifies the proof and is sufficient to prove Cauchy's eigenvalue interlacing theorem.
