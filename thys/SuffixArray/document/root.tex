\title{Formally Verified Suffix Array Construction}
\author{Louis Cheung and Christine Rizkallah}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
A suffix array~\cite{Manber_SIAM_1993} is a data structure that is extensively used in text retrieval and data compression
applications, including query suggestion mechanisms in web search,
and in bioinformatics tools for DNA sequencing and matching.
This wide applicability means that algorithms for constructing suffix
arrays are of great practical importance.
The Suffix Array by Induced Sorting (SA-IS) algorithm~\cite{Nong_DCC_2009}  is a conceptually complex yet highly efficient
suffix array construction technique, based on an earlier algorithm~\cite{Ko_JDA_2005}. 

%Implementing it correctly requires a deep understanding
%of its underlying theory.
%As a vital step towards developing a provably correct implementation
As part of this formalization, we have developed the SA-IS algorithm in Isabelle/HOL
and formally verified that it is equivalent to a mathematical
functional specification of suffix arrays. This required
verifying a wide range of underlying properties of lists and
suffixes, that could be reused in other contexts.
We also used Isabelle's code extraction facilities to extract an
executable Haskell implementation of SAIS. 
In particular, this entry includes the following:
an axiomatic characterisation of suffix array construction;
a formally verified encoding of a straightforward but inefficient suffix array construction algorithm (validating the specification);
and a formally verified encoding of the linear time SA-IS algorithm.
