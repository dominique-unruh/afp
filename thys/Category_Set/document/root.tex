\title{The Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets}
\author{James Baxter \and Dustin Bryant}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  Category theory presents a formulation of mathematical structures in
  terms of common properties of those structures. 
  A particular formulation of interest is the Elementary Theory of the
  Category of Sets (ETCS), which is an axiomatization of set theory in
  category theory terms. 
  This axiomatization provides an unusual view of sets, where the
  functions between sets are regarded as more important than the
  elements of the sets. 
  We formalise an axiomatization of ETCS on top of HOL, following the
  presentation given by Halvorson~\cite{Halvorson2019}. 
  We also build some other set theoretic results on top of the
  axiomatization, including Cantor's diagonalization theorem and
  mathematical induction. 
  We additionally define a system of quantified predicate logic within the ETCS
  axiomatization.
